    "title": "Exclusive: Practo eyes global markets after 6 profitable quarters; pilots underway in US",
    "shortDesc": "IPO-bound digital health platform Practo has posted its first-ever full-year operating EBITDA in FY25. Entrackr has exclusively learned that the company has also kicked off a pilot in the US, with 50–60 paying customers already signed up.The Bengaluru-based company reported an operating EBITDA of Rs 15 crore in FY25, compared to an EBITDA loss of Rs 17 crore in FY24, according to its latest annual letter accessed by Entrackr. During FY25 Practo’s revenue from operations stood at Rs 234 crore, while its gross merchandise value (GMV) remained steady at Rs 3,500 crore. It also achieved positive cash flows, signaling strong capital discipline.Practo showed steady recovery and cost control in FY24, while FY25 demonstrated its ability to scale sustainably. The company claims to have served over 50 million patients across more than 640 cities, supported by a network of 5 lakh doctors.This tech-led efficiency is rooted in Practo’s core ‘Care Navigation’ business, where gross margins grew at a 30% CAGR over the past three years. Its overall contribution margin rose from 40% in FY24 to 46% in FY25, reflecting a sharper focus on high-margin services and improved operational efficiency. As a result, the company turned around from a Rs 162 crore loss in FY22 to a Rs 15 crore profit in FY25, marking a 109% improvement over three years, according to the figures mentioned in the letter.A key focus area driving this momentum is the company’s investment in AI across its product stack. Practo is using artificial intelligence to improve health outcomes, helping patients navigate care more efficiently and enabling smarter workflows and insights for doctors. The firm said it leverages 40 million structured data points to power these AI-led insights.Reinforcing its focus on quality, Practo became the first Indian digital health firm to publish Patient-Reported Outcome Metrics (PROMs). These metrics showed that 78% of telemedicine users and 80% of physical consultation patients reported recovery within three weeks. These figures, based on self-reported outcomes, include patients who did not follow prescribed treatment plans.Building on this outcomes-driven model, Practo deepened its global presence by launching its consumer-facing platform in the UAE in May 2025. Within weeks, the platform onboarded 50,000 monthly active users and hit a Rs 100 crore GMV annual run rate, as per the letter. The company claims that it is on track to reach 10% annual user penetration in Dubai, signaling strong demand for integrated healthcare discovery tools backed by insurance data and cross-border access between Indian and UAE patients and providers.As part of its broader global expansion strategy, Practo aims to double its international revenue over the next few years, while sustaining profitability and scaling its overall impact.",
