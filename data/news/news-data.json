The HCOB Flash Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, reached 51.1, reflecting the highest growth in 15 months, despite persistent export weaknesses.Manufacturing displayed remarkable recovery, with PMI rates climbing to 50.5 from July's 49.8, moving into expansion territory for the first time in over three years. Although services saw slower growth, the euro zone's dominant sector still held ground with a PMI drop from 51.0 to 50.7. Germany led growth with robust manufacturing expansion.Despite positive developments, inflation pressures surged in August with input costs escalating. Service sector costs hit their peak since March, a concern for the European Central Bank, poised to possibly adjust rates in December. The ECB closely watches rising inflation as it aims for stability along with slower wage growth.",

The minister assured that state-specific legal frameworks will be respected and consultations with Northeastern states are underway.In an interview with ANI, Reddy revealed that Arunachal Pradesh has entered the auction realm for coal, and similar explorations are ongoing in Mizoram and Assam. This initiative aligns with the recent Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill 2025, which aims to curb import reliance and bolster domestic production.The government is committing to extensive mining sector reforms, including six legislative amendments. These efforts underline the strategic necessity of critical minerals—from mobile phones to aviation—while supporting India's national security goals. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has allocated 1,200 projects for nationwide exploration, while the National Critical Mineral Mission is set to run with significant funding and investments.",

    "shortDesc": "A majority of Indian consumers are expected to do most of their festive shopping online this year, with advertising playing a major role in shaping purchase decisions, according to a report by Integral Ad Science (IAS).The study conducted in July 2025 with 501 consumers reveals that festive shoppers are planning to spend an average of Rs 16,500 this year, with the majority of consumers planning to start their festive shopping before September.The study found that 82% of consumers plan to shop mainly online, with nearly one-third (31.9%) relying entirely on e-commerce. About 48% said they will buy more online than in-store, while only 2.6% plan to shop only in physical outlets. Mobile will dominate as the preferred device, with 82.6% of consumers saying they will use their phones most for festive purchases.Advertising remains central to consumer choices. According to the study, 90% of shoppers believe online ads are important in helping them discover new products and promotions. Among them, 61% called ads ‘very important’. Context also matters; 60% of consumers said ads based on their past purchases are useful, while 53% value ads placed on safe, reputable sites or those relevant to the content they are consuming.The study also highlights the growing influence of digital platforms. 69% of consumers said they will increase their use of social media for shopping, followed by 68% for video platforms like YouTube and 60% for e-commerce/retail sites. Discounts and promotions (66%) and festival-related content (63%) were identified as the biggest drivers of purchase decisions, alongside online ads (56%) and social media influencers (54%).Shopping budgets are also set to rise. About 86% of consumers said they will spend more than last year, with nearly half reporting a ‘significant increase’. At the same time, 67% plan to shop earlier to avoid high prices and 65% will pay closer attention to discounts.The report noted that impressions served alongside festive shopping content tend to spike during late November and early December. Between November 24 and December 2, impressions were up 233% compared to early November.The findings suggest that this festive season will be marked by strong online spending, with advertising, especially contextually relevant and safe placements, playing a critical role in influencing consumer behaviour.",

As part of this push, Mitra is set to inaugurate a 3,000-tonne refined flour manufacturing plant in October.“This funding is a key pillar in Mitra’s journey as we prepare for our next phase of growth. It will enable us to expand production capacity, launch new health-oriented product lines, and strengthen our presence across India and international markets,” said Abhishek Kaushik, founder and CEO of Mitra. “Our vision is to make Mitra one of the top 5 FMCG companies in India within the next 2–3 years, with a clear roadmap towards an IPO.”The startup, launched in 2023, has positioned itself in tier II and tier III cities by offering premium-quality flour under its “Chakki Fresh” methodology, a stone-grinding process designed to retain nutritional value and freshness, while keeping prices accessible.Mitra claims that its revenue has climbed from Rs 11 crore in FY24 to Rs 40 crore in FY25, with expectations to cross Rs 120 crore this year. Its distribution network currently spans over 500 distributors and 40,000 retail touchpoints. The upcoming flour plant is expected to raise monthly recurring revenue from Rs 12 crore to Rs 17 crore by November 2025. The startup is already EBITDA positive.Mitra has raised nearly Rs 25 crore to date and is preparing a Series A round in April 2026 at a targeted valuation of Rs 500 crore. Raman Sharma, Founder & CEO of Bestvantage Investments, said: “We are delighted to back Mitra in this bridge round. The FMCG sector in India is poised for significant disruption, and Mitra’s ability to blend traditional food preparation methods with modern quality standards makes it a brand with immense potential. Their growth trajectory speaks volumes of the scalability and demand for their products.”",
