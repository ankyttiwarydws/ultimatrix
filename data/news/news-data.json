The HCOB Flash Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, reached 51.1, reflecting the highest growth in 15 months, despite persistent export weaknesses.Manufacturing displayed remarkable recovery, with PMI rates climbing to 50.5 from July's 49.8, moving into expansion territory for the first time in over three years. Although services saw slower growth, the euro zone's dominant sector still held ground with a PMI drop from 51.0 to 50.7. Germany led growth with robust manufacturing expansion.Despite positive developments, inflation pressures surged in August with input costs escalating. Service sector costs hit their peak since March, a concern for the European Central Bank, poised to possibly adjust rates in December. The ECB closely watches rising inflation as it aims for stability along with slower wage growth.",

The minister assured that state-specific legal frameworks will be respected and consultations with Northeastern states are underway.In an interview with ANI, Reddy revealed that Arunachal Pradesh has entered the auction realm for coal, and similar explorations are ongoing in Mizoram and Assam. This initiative aligns with the recent Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill 2025, which aims to curb import reliance and bolster domestic production.The government is committing to extensive mining sector reforms, including six legislative amendments. These efforts underline the strategic necessity of critical minerals—from mobile phones to aviation—while supporting India's national security goals. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has allocated 1,200 projects for nationwide exploration, while the National Critical Mineral Mission is set to run with significant funding and investments.",

    "shortDesc": "A majority of Indian consumers are expected to do most of their festive shopping online this year, with advertising playing a major role in shaping purchase decisions, according to a report by Integral Ad Science (IAS).The study conducted in July 2025 with 501 consumers reveals that festive shoppers are planning to spend an average of Rs 16,500 this year, with the majority of consumers planning to start their festive shopping before September.The study found that 82% of consumers plan to shop mainly online, with nearly one-third (31.9%) relying entirely on e-commerce. About 48% said they will buy more online than in-store, while only 2.6% plan to shop only in physical outlets. Mobile will dominate as the preferred device, with 82.6% of consumers saying they will use their phones most for festive purchases.Advertising remains central to consumer choices. According to the study, 90% of shoppers believe online ads are important in helping them discover new products and promotions. Among them, 61% called ads ‘very important’. Context also matters; 60% of consumers said ads based on their past purchases are useful, while 53% value ads placed on safe, reputable sites or those relevant to the content they are consuming.The study also highlights the growing influence of digital platforms. 69% of consumers said they will increase their use of social media for shopping, followed by 68% for video platforms like YouTube and 60% for e-commerce/retail sites. Discounts and promotions (66%) and festival-related content (63%) were identified as the biggest drivers of purchase decisions, alongside online ads (56%) and social media influencers (54%).Shopping budgets are also set to rise. About 86% of consumers said they will spend more than last year, with nearly half reporting a ‘significant increase’. At the same time, 67% plan to shop earlier to avoid high prices and 65% will pay closer attention to discounts.The report noted that impressions served alongside festive shopping content tend to spike during late November and early December. Between November 24 and December 2, impressions were up 233% compared to early November.The findings suggest that this festive season will be marked by strong online spending, with advertising, especially contextually relevant and safe placements, playing a critical role in influencing consumer behaviour.",

As part of this push, Mitra is set to inaugurate a 3,000-tonne refined flour manufacturing plant in October.“This funding is a key pillar in Mitra’s journey as we prepare for our next phase of growth. It will enable us to expand production capacity, launch new health-oriented product lines, and strengthen our presence across India and international markets,” said Abhishek Kaushik, founder and CEO of Mitra. “Our vision is to make Mitra one of the top 5 FMCG companies in India within the next 2–3 years, with a clear roadmap towards an IPO.”The startup, launched in 2023, has positioned itself in tier II and tier III cities by offering premium-quality flour under its “Chakki Fresh” methodology, a stone-grinding process designed to retain nutritional value and freshness, while keeping prices accessible.Mitra claims that its revenue has climbed from Rs 11 crore in FY24 to Rs 40 crore in FY25, with expectations to cross Rs 120 crore this year. Its distribution network currently spans over 500 distributors and 40,000 retail touchpoints. The upcoming flour plant is expected to raise monthly recurring revenue from Rs 12 crore to Rs 17 crore by November 2025. The startup is already EBITDA positive.Mitra has raised nearly Rs 25 crore to date and is preparing a Series A round in April 2026 at a targeted valuation of Rs 500 crore. Raman Sharma, Founder & CEO of Bestvantage Investments, said: “We are delighted to back Mitra in this bridge round. The FMCG sector in India is poised for significant disruption, and Mitra’s ability to blend traditional food preparation methods with modern quality standards makes it a brand with immense potential. Their growth trajectory speaks volumes of the scalability and demand for their products.”",

In addition, SMD & Co. was named as the company’s secretarial auditor for the period FY26–FY30.The leadership transition comes at a challenging time for the company. EaseMyTrip’s revenue fell 25.5% year-on-year to Rs 114 crore in the first quarter of FY26, while profit after tax plunged 98.7% to Rs 44 lakh from Rs 34 crore a year earlier.In January, Nishant Pitti stepped down as chief executive, with Rikant Pitti taking over as CEO. On Friday, the company said both Nishant and Rikant have voluntarily chosen to forgo their salaries temporarily to underscore alignment with shareholder interests and reinforce confidence in EaseMyTrip’s long-term growth prospects.",

    "title": "GST Council Meeting Clears Dual Tax Slabs Of 5%, 18% Implementation From Sept 22: Report",
    "shortDesc": "The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, at its 56th meeting chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, has approved a dual tax structure of 5 per cent and 18 per cent, replacing the existing four-rate system. The new regime, which removes the 12 per cent and 18 per cent slabs, will come into effect from September 22, as per sources cited by news agency ANI.According to West Bengal Finance Minister, the rationalisation will lead to an overall revenue loss of ₹47,700 crore. The meeting, which began on September 3 and concludes on September 4, deliberated on easing compliance and lowering taxes on essential goods to stimulate consumption amid global trade headwinds.News agency PTI reported that the Council discussed reducing GST on insurance premiums, rationalising footwear and apparel duties, and streamlining compliance with faster refund timelines. A special 40 per cent rate for luxury items such as high-end cars, tobacco and cigarettes also remains under consideration.Items Set to Get CheaperDaily-use goods such as butter, ghee, jam, dry fruits, biscuits, pastry, ice cream, namkeen, bottled water, fruit juices and beverages containing milk are expected to shift to the lower 5 per cent slab from the current 18 per cent. Similarly, footwear and apparel priced up to ₹2,500 will now attract 5 per cent GST, up from the earlier ₹1,000 threshold.Consumer goods including feeding bottles, kitchenware, bicycles, umbrellas and bamboo furniture may also see reduced tax rates. In addition, items like toothpaste, shampoo, soap and hair oil could drop from 18 per cent to 5 per cent. Cement, meanwhile, is set to become cheaper with GST lowered from 28 per cent to 18 per cent.On the other hand, garments and footwear above ₹2,500 will now attract 18 per cent GST, while high-end automobiles, motorcycles above 350 cc, yachts and private aircraft are under discussion for the steep 40 per cent slab.States Voice Concerns Over LossesWhile the Centre projects that GST reforms could boost growth by up to 0.5 percentage points in the medium term, several opposition-ruled states have flagged concerns over revenue erosion. Ahead of the Council meet, ministers from Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal convened separately to push for a compensation framework.Himachal Pradesh Minister Rajesh Dharmani told news agency ANI, \"Unanimously, everyone has agreed in favour of GST rate rationalisation. Now there will be three slabs. Effectively, it will be 5% and 18% percent. 12% and 28% have been abolished. There will be 40% on luxury goods.\"Jharkhand Finance Minister Radhakrishna Kishore said his state could lose ₹2,000 crore annually under the revised structure. “If the Centre agrees to compensate us for whatever loss we would incur, then we have no issues in approving the agenda before the Council. I don’t think the issue will come up for voting, as in a federal structure, it is the responsibility of the Centre to compensate states for revenue loss,” Kishore told reporters.In a press statement, he further said, “Jharkhand is a manufacturing state. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) system has adversely affected the state’s internal revenue collection.” He noted that between 2017 and 2024-25, the state has already lost ₹16,408 crore in revenue, with the figure expected to rise to nearly ₹61,670 crore by 2029.Kishore emphasised that “around 75 to 80 per cent of coal and steel production from Jharkhand is consumed outside the state. Thus, the benefits of GST are accruing to consumer states.” He urged the Centre to provide a guaranteed minimum of ₹2,000 crore annually until Jharkhand’s revenue stabilises.",

    "shortDesc": "Bangladesh has become Asia’s most active buyer of spot LNG cargoes – an unlikely new heavyweight in one of the world’s most volatile energy markets. Once largely self-sufficient in natural gas, the country now leans heavily on imported fuel to keep its factories running and its power sector alive. The shift is dramatic: gas still meets 43% of Bangladesh’s total energy needs, but domestic production is falling, reserves are dwindling, and the gap is being filled at a soaring cost. What began as a stopgap after shortages in 2017–18 has snowballed into structural dependence, pushing Bangladesh into the spotlight of the global LNG trade – and exposing the financial and systemic weaknesses that brought it there. * Bangladesh has become Asia’s most active spot LNG buyer as domestic gas output falls and demand rises. * Long-term deals with Qatar and Oman cover only part of the gap, so spot imports have surged. * Reliance on spot LNG is creating financial and energy-security risks. Domestic production peaked at 27 bcm/y in 2018, but will have slipped to 20 bcm/y by 2025. Consumption, meanwhile, was at 29 bcm/y in 2025 and is forecast to rise even higher. The shortfall is widening, and [...]The post Bangladesh Becomes LNG’s Hottest Story appeared first on Energy Bangla.",

    "shortDesc": "Kavin Bharti Mittal, son of Airtel's Sunil Bharti Mittal, said his 13-year-old startup Hike would close down entirely, marking the end of a company once touted as India’s answer to WhatsApp. The decision follows the government’s recent ban on real-money gaming (RMG), a regulatory move that has upended business models across the gaming sector.In a post on LinkedIn, Mittal, founder and CEO of Hike, said that while the firm’s US business had shown early traction since launching nine months ago, continuing operations globally would require a full recapitalisation. “After the India ban, scaling globally would require a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time,” he wrote.Hike has about $4 million left on its balance sheet, which will be used for vendor payments and employee severance, with any remaining funds returned to investors.Founded in 2012 as a messaging app, Hike at its peak boasted more than 100 million users before shutting down Hike Messenger in 2021. The company later pivoted into gaming and Web3, launching two products: Vibe, a community platform, and Rush, a real-money gaming service that scaled to 10 million users and generated $500 million in gross revenue over four years. Despite those gains, Mittal said recurring tax disputes, regulatory battles, and now the RMG ban made continuation untenable.“RMG was never the destination. It was a means to prove unit economics and unlock the bigger vision. But we got locked into the Indian market in a tax/regulation battle,” he told investors. “For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors.”Hike had raised about $261 million from Tiger Global, Tencent, and Bharti Enterprises, among others. Mittal noted that while the shutdown was a disappointment, the lessons and networks built through Hike would inform his next chapter. He pointed to emerging opportunities in artificial intelligence, energy, and other frontier technologies.The closure underscores a broader reckoning in India’s gaming industry following the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act 2025. Several players, including Mobile Premier League and WinZO, have scaled back or reoriented their strategies, while startups such as Zupee and Probo have seen their business models disrupted.“This chapter ends, but the climb continues,” Mittal wrote, framing the decision not as a defeat but as a reset.",

    "title": "Gameskraft lays off 120 employees weeks after the ban on real-money gaming",
    "shortDesc": "India’s gaming sector is facing a severe shake-up in the wake of the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, with Bengaluru-based Gameskraft becoming the latest casualty.The company on Thursday confirmed that it has suspended operations entirely and begun a sweeping restructuring exercise that includes laying off about 120 employees.The move comes just weeks after Parliament passed the new law banning online real-money gaming. Policymakers have defended the ban as a safeguard against addiction and financial losses, while industry leaders warn that it risks driving users towards unregulated offshore platforms.Founded in 2017, Gameskraft grew into one of India’s largest online gaming companies with offerings across card games, casual titles, and real-money formats. But the regulatory framework, along with rising compliance obligations and tax burdens, has left the company unable to continue its business.“Despite our best efforts, the current regulatory landscape has made us completely stop our business and has left us with no choice but to initiate a company-wide restructuring,” the company told employees in a note.The layoffs affect multiple teams and functions, with the company warning that further structural changes may follow. Founder and CEO Prithvi Singh called the decision “one of the most difficult” in Gameskraft’s journey, emphasising that it was driven by the external environment rather than employee performance.The announcement comes at a time when Gameskraft is already battling internal turmoil. Earlier this month, the company accused former CFO Ramesh Prabhu of siphoning off Rs 270.43 crore over nearly five years through personal trading in futures and options. The case is under police investigation.Despite the crisis, the company has announced an extensive support package for affected staff. This includes medical insurance coverage until March 2026, continuation of wellness and health services through May 2026, the option to convert group policies into individual plans, leave encashment based on full salary, and priority rehiring if Gameskraft pivots into new business areas. Outplacement assistance, referrals, and recommendation letters will also be provided.",

    "title": "FNZ Employee Shareholders question the actions of FNZ's Chairman and investor Motive Partners with a US$4.6 billion lawsuit pending",
    "shortDesc": "LONDON, Sept. 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- FNZ employee shareholders – who collectively hold over 30% of the company's equity – are questioning the actions of FNZ's Chairman and private equity firm Motive Partners. This follows a year of alleged relentless executive turnover, unprecedented increases in expenditure to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars and repeated failure to deliver on the strategy introduced by the private equity firm Motive Partners. A spokesperson for the Employee Shareholders, who have filed a US$4.6 billion class action against FNZ Group Limited and 17 of its current and former Directors, said the Chairman must be held accountable for the alleged lack of governance that has allowed this private equity firm to take control of the management of the company and, presumably, all flow of information to the Board. Since September 2024, when Motive Partners installed its own personnel in senior leadership roles, a large number of senior leaders have left including recent sudden departures of the firms CRO, COO and CTO. \"We've lost all the leadership and knowledge that built FNZ to date, but it still needs to continue to build and grow as a growth company. In its place, we have Motive Partners with no relevant experience in actually building companies, let alone building technology companies. The company is being run according to a relatively junior, lower tier, private equity playbook.\" said a spokesperson for the Employee Shareholders. \"In addition, Motive's recent investment in several direct competitors of FNZ raises the question of what Motive's agenda really is. Overwhelmingly Private Equity investors would avoid such conflicts in their portfolio companies.\" A class action filed in the High Court of New Zealand by FNZ's employee shareholders alleges the deliberate and oppressive dilution of employee shareholders' holdings, as well as the direct transfer of their equity to conflicted institutional and private equity shareholders. Motive Partners would seem to be playing a central role.",

    "title": "Kerala: Sabarimala gold row deepens, no gold plating, only copper; Devaswom Board and CM Vijayan accused of collusion",
    "shortDesc": "The story of the Sabarimala gold loss has taken new turns, with Adv. K.B. Pradeepkumar, the lawyer of Smart Creations, the firm responsible for the gold plating, reportedly stating that copper layers were brought from Sabarimala and not a single gram of gold had been plated on them. He clarified that his company does not accept, for gold plating, any material previously gold-plated elsewhere. According to Pradeepkumar, the copper layers were brought to the company in 2019 by Unnikrishnan Potti and others, and 897 grams of gold were used for plating. He further stated that the copper layers weighed 47 kilograms when they were brought to Smart Creations. Pradeepkumar revealed that officials of the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) accompanied Unnikrishnan Potti when he came to collect the gold-plated layers. The 2019 layers had faded and were therefore re-plated. Under normal circumstances, the company provides a warranty of 20 to 40 years. The firm had also carried out gold plating for the Malikappuram Temple, the Devi temple adjacent to the Sabarimala shrine, regarded as an upadevata and those works remain intact. The advocate said that a detailed statement would be submitted before the High Court shortly. Now, questions are being raised about what happened to the gold-plated layers dedicated by Vijay Mallya in 1999. It appears that the Devaswom Minister, the Devaswom Board President, and Unnikrishnan Potti have come under a cloud of suspicion. Reports suggest that Vigilance officials will interrogate Potti in connection with financial irregularities. Read MorE: Kerala: Pinarayi’s gold smuggling comments against Malappuram district sparks war of words between CPI (M) and UDF Sources from Thiruvananthapuram indicate that several crucial documents have been recovered relating to Rs 30 crore worth of land transactions by Unnikrishnan Potti within just three years. Investigations are ongoing. It is alleged that he lent money at exorbitant interest rates and seized land from those unable to repay. These land dealings were reportedly conducted in the names of his mother and wife. Meanwhile, crucial documents concerning the 30 kilograms of gold dedicated to the Sabarimala shrine by Vijay Mallya have been recovered from the Public Works Department of the Devaswom Board. An important question now arises: How did the Dwarapalakas plated with the gold dedicated by Vijay Mallya in 1998 turn into copper by 2019? Mallya had handed over 30 kilograms of gold and 1,900 kilograms of copper to the Devaswom Board. The roof of the shrine and the Dwarapalaka idols were plated with this gold. However, it was later claimed that the plating had faded, and the items were sent to Smart Creations for re-plating. Unnikrishnan Potti has alleged that he received only copper layers. Although the investigation team had demanded documents regarding Vijay Mallya’s gold donation, the Devaswom authorities initially claimed that the documents were missing. However, they were eventually found in the Public Works Department. Former Union Minister and senior BJP leader V. Muraleedharan questioned who authorised handing over the golden layers to a person accused in an arson case. He alleged that former Devaswom Minister and CPM leader Kadakampalli Surendran and former Devaswom Board President Padmakumar were fully aware of the issue. He demanded an investigation by central agencies. Reports also suggest that Unnikrishnan Potti is accused in a criminal case involving housebreaking, assault, and arson in Thiruvananthapuram. He is also allegedly involved in a case related to collecting money from outside the state. Muraleedharan, on October 3, accused the Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan of attempting to turn the Sabarimala shrine into a mercantile commodity, with the support of Kadakampalli Surendran and Padmakumar. He demanded that the government explain how Vijay Mallya’s gold turned into copper, accusing the Devaswom Board of shifting blame to its officials. He asserted that the former Devaswom Minister and Board President are primarily responsible. “Taking out the golden layers and handing them over to someone is a criminal act,” he said. Muraleedharan further alleged that the removal of the golden layers coincided with the Pinarayi regime’s stand to violate Sabarimala traditions. He questioned the nexus between Unnikrishnan Potti and the Board, asking, “Where were the golden layers kept for 40 days after removal? Who authorised Potti to carry them around for exhibitions?” Despite violations of the Devaswom Manual, the Board allegedly failed to take action. “Repairs should have been done near the shrine itself. Why did the Board hesitate to act?” he asked.

The same Potti is an accused in an arson case and is absconding. How can the temple’s gold be placed in the custody of such a person?” he asked. Muraleedharan accused the government of treating Hindu temples as free-for-all entities, adding, “Would they take the same approach with places of worship belonging to other religions?” He alleged that the Devaswom Vigilance wing is ineffective. “Those who failed to expose the loot and corruption in Sabarimala cannot be expected to do anything now. Only central agencies can unearth the truth behind this looting,” he said. Film Actor Jayaram in Trouble Reports indicate that Unnikrishnan Potti took the golden layers to the Chennai residence of Malayalam–Tamil matinee idol Jayaram, after conducting exhibitions in several places across Chennai, and performed a puja there with his family members. Actor Jayaram and noted singer Veeramani also attended. Jayaram reportedly told the media at the time that the layers were brought to his house after the plating work was completed. Similar exhibitions were also held in Bengaluru, where Potti allegedly aimed to amass money. However, the Devaswom Board’s inaction in preventing such private exhibitions of Sabarimala’s sacred doors and frames demonstrates the inefficiency and corruption prevailing within the Board. Reports suggest that Potti has enjoyed VIP status in Sabarimala since 2019, implying that he could not have handled the shrine’s assets without strong [...]",

    "title": "GST cuts spark festive sales boom across India, from Cuttack to Noida",
    "shortDesc": "Puri/Cuttack/Noida: A wave of festive enthusiasm is sweeping across Indian markets, thanks to the recent GST rate cuts that have reduced prices on essential and electronic goods. From Odisha to Uttar Pradesh, shopkeepers and customers alike are expressing gratitude to the central government for easing financial pressure and reviving business in time for Diwali.In Cuttack, a local customer shared how the GST reduction on electronics has made everyday luxuries more accessible. “The GST on daily-use items like air conditioners and refrigerators has been reduced from 28 pc to 18 pc. We are now able to buy these products more easily and at lower prices. This relief is only possible due to the efforts of the Prime Minister and his ministers.”Amit Biswal, a shopkeeper in Cuttack, echoed the sentiment. “Earlier, customers would inquire about prices and leave without buying. Now, they are purchasing happily. The reduced GST has boosted our business significantly.”Moving to Puri, Odisha, Shiv Prasad Dash, another shop owner, praised the government's timely decision. “Earlier, people hesitated to buy in bulk. But now, prices have come down, and customers are flocking in. Consumer interest has increased, and the Puja season sales have been excellent. I’m very grateful to the government.”In Noida, the trend is similar. With inflation at its lowest in 99 months and GST rates slashed on many goods—especially electronics—markets are buzzing with energy. “The Diwali season is in full swing. Compared to last year, our sales have increased significantly. The 10 pc GST reduction on electronics has brought customers back to offline stores,” said a local shopkeeper.From Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, shopkeepers report a surge in footfall. “After GST was reduced, more customers started visiting our shops. This festive season, we're competing with online platforms. Both customers and traders are happy,” said a shopkeeper.Across all regions, the message is loud and clear — GST reform has brought financial relief to households, revived market demand, and reignited festive spirit across India. With increased consumer confidence, traders are optimistic that this season will mark one of the strongest sales periods in recent years.(IANS)",

    "title": "Best Crypto to Invest in Now: Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Standing Out Against Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2025",
    "shortDesc": "In 2025, the crypto market grows, with investors looking for projects that represent more than potential speculative returns. Although Dogecoin (DOGE) is still a favorite, the meme-based currency constrains long-term growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is emerging as a credible player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Mutuum Finance is in Phase 6 of its presale with the project having so far raised over $17.35 million. Over 65% of this phase is sold out at $0.035 per MUTM token. This heavy investor interest is a clear vote of confidence in MUTM's disruptive vision of re-engineering the future of DeFi.The double-lending framework of MUTM, as a blend of both Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools together with Peer-to-Peer contracts, enables both the borrowing and lending within the same domain with effective use of capital. This distinguishes MUTM as the next-gen DeFi protocol with the intent to generate sustainable growth opportunities both among the long-term and the short-term players. As a project with both innovation as well as strong potential to generate high returns, MUTM offers a promising investment opportunity among investors to diversify their portfolios during the year 2025.Dogecoin Price Analysis: Bullish Momentum Reaches Key Levels of ResistanceDogecoin (DOGE) is showing short-term bullish strength after the breakout of prior consolidation, yet the meme currency now needs to clear major resistance zones that will dictate what happens next. On the 30-minute chart, DOGE is making a push towards $0.22028 and $0.24143, two major resistance zones where interest in selling could emerge. A rejection off $0.22028, confirmed with the help of reversal candles like pin bars or high wicks, can set the tone towards a pullback towards the $0.19840 and $0.17488 zones of significant support.Traders tracking bullish set-ups within this area, however, should be tracking the signals of reversals because a clear breakout and close above $0.24143 with significant volumes could generate a new upward surge. As long as DOGE is testing these major levels, there are still many investors who are shifting the watch lists to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), picking up momentum towards the 2025 market cycle.Mutuum Finance Heats Up in Q4Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a crypto worth looking up to within the DeFi environment. Already in Phase 6 presale, the tokens are selling at $0.035 up from Phase 5 by 16.17%. Already over 17040 investors have invested over $17.35 million value within the presale, trusting in the long-term road map of the project. With over 65% already sold in Phase 6, investors have very little time to acquire the tokens prior to the phase expiring.The project is also in collaboration with CertiK to launch the $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, whereby white-hat hackers, program developers, as well as security researchers, are compensated for the discovery of bugs. The bugs are ranked according to the level of their seriousness, i.e., critical, major, minor, as well as low, as well as compensated accordingly.Lending and Borrowing Protocol Launch Also included is the release of Mutuum Finance lending and borrowing protocol. Version 1 (V1), scheduled to be released on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025, will comprise the following major features, i.e., liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, along with a liquidator bot. ETH as well as USDT will be supported on the very first day to collateralization, borrowing, as well as lending, with emphasis on developing an end-to-end DeFi solution that is secure, scalable, as well as user-friendly.Mutuum Finance Shines in 2025Though Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to rely on market hype alongside momentum from the fan base, MUTUM Finance (MUTM) is the smart, utility-driven choice among investors looking to retain long-term value. Having secured over $17.35 million from over 17,040 investors as it closes 65% of Phase 6 at $0.035 per token, MUTM traction is reflective of strong market confidence in its fundamentals. Through the double-lending construct fusing Peer-to-Contract alongside Peer-to-Peer mechanisms, the platform presents unmatched flexibility alongside cap efficiency within the paradigm of the DeFi environment. Sign up to the MUTUM Finance presale now as they secure their position before Phase 6 closures.For more information regarding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) please use the following links:Website: https://mutuum.com/Linktree: https://linktr.ee/mutuumfinanceDisclaimer: This is a sponsored article.

    "title": "Chicken Road Game in India: Why It’s Becoming a Mobile Sensation",
    "shortDesc": "If you’ve spent any time scrolling through gaming reels or short YouTube clips lately, you’ve probably seen it — a cartoon chicken frantically running across a busy road while cars, trucks, and buses speed by. Someone yells in the background, “Go, go, go—ahh!” The bird gets flattened. Everyone laughs.That’s the Chicken Road Game — the tiny, silly-looking mobile game that’s somehow turned into a full-blown obsession in India. Read more about how to play chicken road game and win!A Simple Game That’s Anything But BoringAt first glance, Chicken Road doesn’t look like much. There are no flashy graphics, no cinematic intros, no complex tutorials. You just tap the screen, move your chicken forward, and try not to get hit. That’s it.But that’s the genius of it.It’s one of those games that takes five seconds to understand — and then hours to put down. The simplicity is exactly what makes it addictive. Every road you cross feels like a small victory; every failure, an invitation to try “just one more time.”It’s the kind of casual fun that fits perfectly into Indian life. You can play it while waiting for your train, during a tea break, or right before bed.How It Blew Up So Fast in IndiaNobody really saw it coming. Chicken Road https://chickenroads.mobi/ just appeared on the app stores, started popping up in memes and gaming groups, and within weeks, everyone seemed to be talking about it.The reason for its sudden success isn’t just luck — it’s timing.India’s mobile gaming scene has exploded in the last three years. Data is cheap, phones are faster, and casual games are what most people want — something lightweight, fun, and stress-relieving. Chicken Road checks all those boxes.Plus, it’s funny. Watching a chicken narrowly dodge traffic or get hit by a bus in a dramatic slow-motion moment is comedy gold. Streamers love it because it’s perfect for reactions. Viewers love it because it’s chaos.That’s how virality works now — one meme, one clip, one absurdly close escape — and boom, you’ve got millions of downloads.Built for the Indian PlayerAnother big reason Chicken Road works so well here? Accessibility.The game runs smoothly on almost any Android phone. It doesn’t eat data, doesn’t force you to log in, and doesn’t demand a powerful device. For a country where over 80% of gamers use budget or mid-range smartphones, that’s a huge plus.And while it’s not an Indian-made game, the humor and fast pace feel tailor-made for Indian players. It has that same mix of frustration and fun you find in games like Ludo King or Subway Surfers — simple, chaotic, and endlessly replayable.A Game That Lives on Social MediaWhat really pushed Chicken Road into the spotlight isn’t just downloads — it’s visibility.You’ll see it everywhere online:People posting their “unbelievable streaks.”Memes comparing their chicken to Virat Kohli “dodging fielders.”Reaction videos of near misses that look scripted by destiny.The Chicken Road community is hilarious. Players comment things like “I swear this game knows when I’m tired” or “I almost made it, then the bus respawned from nowhere.”It’s this shared frustration and laughter that’s made it more than a game — it’s become a tiny cultural moment.A Touch of Challenge Keeps It AliveDespite its funny exterior, Chicken Road isn’t mindless. The traffic patterns get faster, the timing tighter, and every mistake costs you progress. That little mix of skill and chaos keeps people hooked.Some players treat it like a sport now — competing for high scores, streaming their runs, even sharing “strategies” for crossing trickier roads. It’s absurd, but also kind of impressive.It’s proof that you don’t need a massive 3D world or multiplayer battles to create challenge — just the right amount of tension and reward.Why It Connects So Deeply with Indian GamersIf you think about it, Chicken Road hits a nerve that’s very specific to how Indian gamers play.It’s short, funny, dramatic, and forgiving. You don’t need Wi-Fi or a team. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a village or a city, if you play once a day or fifty times an hour — it feels the same: quick, chaotic fun.That’s the beauty of mobile gaming here — it’s universal. Chicken Road manages to bridge that gap perfectly.What’s Next for the Chicken?As of now, the game’s still growing fast. Updates keep rolling in — new maps, sound effects, maybe even multiplayer modes soon.And while some people will eventually move on to the next viral hit, Chicken Road’s simplicity might just give it staying power. Like Flappy Bird or Subway Surfers, it could quietly sit on people’s phones for years, waiting for that next “I’ll just play one round” moment.Final ThoughtsChicken Road’s success isn’t some fluke. It’s a reflection of what Indian players love: games that are easy to jump into, funny to fail at, and satisfying to master.It’s small, it’s silly, and it’s everywhere — and honestly, that’s kind of perfect.Sometimes, all a game needs to win people over is a chicken, a busy road, and a lot of patience.",

    "shortDesc": "New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday denied social media claims that it sold 35 tonnes of gold from its reserves, calling them \"unsubstantiated rumours\". In a post shared by the PIB Fact Check Unit on X, the central bank clarified that no such sale had taken place and urged the public to rely only on official sources for verified information.The RBI also advised users to refer to its official website for accurate data and updates.\"Reserve Bank of India, through PIB Fact Check Unit, has debunked claims that 35 tonnes of gold have been sold by RBI from its reserves. RBI cautions against unsubstantiated rumours on social media. For any information pertaining to RBI, please visit the official website http://rbi.org.in,\" the RBI posted on its official X handle.The clarification comes amid heightened global interest and volatility in the gold market, as several major central banks continue to ramp up their gold purchases. Emerging market economies, in particular, have been increasing their gold holdings to diversify away from the US dollar — a trend that gained momentum after the freezing of Russia’s reserve assets in 2022.This strategic accumulation has pushed gold’s share of total global reserves to over 20 per cent, reinforcing its status as a \"sanction-proof\" store of value.Meanwhile, analysts note that the ongoing rally in gold prices is also linked to what’s known as the “debasement trade” — the idea that political uncertainty could weaken the dollar and fuel inflation, prompting investors to turn to gold as a safe haven.However, recent market data suggests otherwise, as both the US dollar and Treasury yields have remained stable, contradicting the notion of a weakening currency environment.(IANS)",

    "title": "Karnataka: ED chargesheets Congress MLA Satish Sail in illegal iron ore export case; Rs 44cr loss to state exchequer",
    "shortDesc": "Bengaluru: In a major development in the decade-old Belekeri iron ore illegal export case, the Enforcement Directorate(ED) has filed a detailed chargesheet before the Special Court for People’s Representatives against Congress MLA Satish Sail. The chargesheet asserts that the MLA is involved in criminal conspiracy, illegal financial transactions and facilitating large-scale iron ore exports that allegedly caused a loss of Rs. 44.09 crore to the state treasury. According to the ED, Sail, along with other accused, played an active role in exporting iron ore through unlawful means from the Belekeri port. The investigation alleges that instead of exporting the ore to genuine Chinese buyers as mandated, the accused rerouted the shipments through foreign shell companies, thereby masking the financial trail and violating export regulations. Foreign bank accounts revealed One of the most serious allegations in the chargesheet is that Satish Sail maintained foreign bank accounts in Hong Kong. The ED has cited evidence of accounts held in Hong Kong’s Standard Chartered Bank and ICBC Bank. The agency claims that these accounts were used to safegaurd the illicit funds linked to the illegal iron ore trade. According to the ED, the modus operandi involved exporting low-grade iron ore under inflated invoices, wrong declaration of the quantity and value and diverting the profits to safe-havens in abroad. These alleged actions, the agency says, were part of a coordinated criminal conspiracy involving exporters, shipping agents, customs officials and political actors. Massive gains for private company The chargesheet states that Mallikarjun Shipping Pvt. Ltd., a company linked to the illegal shipments, made profits of Rs. 27 crore through the alleged fraudulent exports. Investigators believe the company acted as a conduit between the exporters and overseas buyers, facilitating the transactions and ensuring the proceeds were transferred to foreign accounts. During the ED raids at Sail’s residence and other properties earlier, the agency seized Rs. 1.68 crore in unaccounted cash and 6.75 kg of gold. The seizure, according to the agency, substantiates the allegation of illegal proceeds being siphoned off and concealed. Frozen bank accounts and attached properties As part of the ongoing probe, the ED has frozen bank accounts holding Rs. 14.13 crore belonging to the accused. Further, the agency has provisionally attached three immovable properties valued at Rs. 21 crore, issuing notices under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). These actions mark one of the most significant breakthroughs in the long-standing investigation that dates back to the massive illegal mining and export scandals that once rocked Karnataka’s political and administrative establishment. Background of the Belekeri case The Belekeri port scam first came to light when large volumes of illegally mined iron ore were discovered to have been exported between 2008 and 2010. Several high-ranking officials and politicians were accused of facilitating these exports and massive irregularities were reported in documentation, transportation and customs clearances. Sail, who had earlier been interrogated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Lokayukta SIT, has maintained that he was not involved in any wrongdoing. However, the ED’s chargesheet claims otherwise, stating that the MLA had direct links to the financial transactions and decision-making that enabled the illegal exports. Also Read: The Silent Health Revolution in Bharat: TB 21%, Malaria 69%, HIV infections down by 44% among 12 others in four years Political reverberations expected The filing of the chargesheet is likely to trigger significant political ripples in Karnataka, especially within the ruling Congress party. Satish Sail, currently representing the Karwar constituency, is considered an influential figure in coastal politics. Opposition parties are expected to use the development to target the Congress government, especially at a time when corruption allegations are being widely debated. Party sources say the high command may seek an internal explanation from Sail, though a formal response is yet to be issued. Meanwhile, ED officials say the investigation is ongoing and further chargesheets may follow, depending on the outcome of financial forensic analysis and international banking records. The Belekeri scandal, which once exposed Karnataka’s illegal mining nexus, appears far from over, with the latest chargesheet rekindling public attention and intensifying scrutiny of the political figures involved.",

The startup is developing India focused language models across all 22 constitutionally recognised languages and plans to expand its AI suite for learning, career growth and workplace productivity.Founded in 2018 by Felix Kim, Redrob operates an AI driven outbound intelligence platform that blends natural language search with data from more than 19 sources. Its PeopleSearch engine gives access to more than 700 million global professional profiles and is used for lead generation, intent filtering and outreach. The company expects the funding to strengthen the reach of its AI Suite, especially through PeopleSearch.Redrob is preparing several India specific initiatives. It plans to offer free Redrob LLM access to all Indian universities in Q1 2026. It is also in talks with the Ministry of Education for nationwide student access. Alongside this, the startup is building an enterprise suite for Indian SMBs and startups and aims to provide full multi language support by the end of 2026.Kartikey Handa, Chief Operating Officer and Head of India Operations at Redrob, said, \"We want every Indian student to have free access to premium AI tools to pave the way for a freer India. Today, high-end AI models cost so much that they remain far out of reach for most people in India and other emerging markets. Redrob's breakthroughs deliver significant cost reductions through advanced ML techniques, enabling us to offer high-quality performance at a fraction of the cost.\"Handa added, \"Traditional AI infrastructure perpetuates a divide between developed and emerging economies. We're opening up the AI technology for everybody to a point where a data scientist living in Bangalore will have the same AI facilities as the richest companies in the world.\"He also said he believes the next wave of AI will not come from San Francisco or London. \"We are constructing the infrastructure that the entire 1.4 billion Indian population will have access to during the AI revolution. We are making sure that no Indian among the 1.4 billion is left isolated when the AI revolution comes. That's not just a business opportunity, but it's more of a responsibility.\"",

Malaysia Pavilion Closing Ceremony & Closing Speech - The Hon. Dato’ Sri Huang Tiong Sii, Deputy Minister, Natural Resources Throughout the 10 day program from 10th until 21st November 2025, the Malaysia Pavilion hosted 25 sessions featuring speakers from local and global government, industry, academia, and civil society, drawing over 1,100 participants in person and online, and more than 5,000 visitors to the pavilion to learn more about the Malaysian culture as well as the nation's initiatives in climate action. Centred on five key thematic pillars, Restoring Rainforests, Rivers, and Reefs; Energy Transition Pathways for Developing Nations; Climate Justice in the Global South; Future-Proofing Water, Food Systems, and Industry; and Unlocking Finance for Net Zero, the Pavilion fostered impactful discussions on Malaysia's holistic and inclusive approach to sustainability. These dialogues reflected the nation's commitment to bridging policy, innovation, and community action, ensuring that every conversation can be translated into actionable pathways towards net zero. Deputy Minister of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability (NRES), YB Dato' Sri Huang Tiong Sii, said, \"This year's Pavilion, themed Climate Action Now: Net Zero Pathways Unlocked, truly represents Malaysia's evolution from ambition to implementation. Even as some parts of the world begin to waver in their climate commitments, Malaysia remains resolute in pushing forward our agenda for a sustainable, just, and resilient future. We believe that genuine progress requires persistence, and we will continue to act decisively, guided by science, strengthened by partnerships, and driven by our shared responsibility to the planet and future generations.\" Meanwhile, the Malaysia Pavilion explored intergenerational leadership through a panel of youths where young leaders took the stage to highlight how their generation is shaping climate governance as rights-holders and partners in co-creating solutions with policymakers and institutions. The \"Youth on the Brink: Shaping the Future of Sustainable Change\" session concluded with breakout groups that allowed attendees to exchange insights and expectations on COP30, underscoring the value of inclusive engagement in shaping climate outcomes. COP30 in Belém delivered a package of decisions that shifted the global climate agenda toward implementation, equity, and resilience, while revealing persistent gaps in global mitigation ambition. Parties agreed to triple adaptation finance by 2035, established a new climate finance work programme, and launched both the Global Implementation Accelerator and to develop a Just Transition Mechanism to support equitable and green transitions. Adaptation efforts were strengthened through the adoption of a voluntary global indicator framework for the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA). Another achievement was the adoption of the Belém Gender Action Plan, which embeds gender equality, inclusion, and women's leadership across climate policymaking and implementation. This reinforces the need for climate actions that respond to the differentiated needs of women and girls, especially those in vulnerable and marginalized communities. Under the Global Stocktake (GST), COP30 advanced guidance for the second GST process in 2028, emphasizing alignment with the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement and enhanced support for developing countries. Progress under the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP) focused on continuing technical dialogues and sectoral cooperation to accelerate emissions reductions. Nature and land use also received heightened attention, including the launch of the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, designed to provide long-term, performance-based financing for tropical forest conservation. However, Parties again failed to reach agreement on a binding global phase-out of fossil fuels and commitments on deforestation and land-use remained largely voluntary and lacking enforceability. Key decisions in particular on fossil fuels, forest protection, and climate-finance delivery are long-dated or non-binding, limiting their near-term impact and leaving significant mitigation gaps. Overall, COP30 delivered meaningful institutional and financial frameworks that can benefit developing countries, especially in advancing adaptation, gender-responsive climate action, just transitions, and nature conservation. COP30 also underscores the need for accelerated political will and stronger outcomes at future COPs to keep the 1.5°C goal within reach. The Malaysia Pavilion stands as a testament to Malaysia's readiness to lead by example, demonstrating that sustainable growth and environmental stewardship can progress hand-in-hand. As COP30 draws to a close, the Pavilion reaffirms that the journey toward net zero is not just a whole-of-nation, but a whole-of-region approach that requires collective commitment of governments, private sectors, communities, and individuals alike. Looking ahead to COP31 in Antalya, Türkiye, Malaysia carries forward the collaborative spirit of Belém and the global mutirão, committed to unlocking new pathways to net zero and continuing to inspire global action through leadership, innovation, and resolve. The Malaysia Pavilion at COP30 is spearheaded by NRES, implemented by the Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Corporation (MGTC), and supported by national partners Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) and Maybank.

    "title": "india-green-hydrogen-mission-turns-to-toyota-mirai-followup-analysis",
    "shortDesc": "It was a short drive which spelt a giant leap for the transport sector’s hydrogen dreams. Or at least the global debate over Battery EVs operating on lithium versus Fuel cells operating on Hydrogen.Union minister for new and renewable energy Prahlad Joshi launched a pilot project last week in Delhi for the National Institute of Solar Energy to test a new fuel cell electric vehicle or FCEV under real-world Indian conditions. WATCH: Pralhad Joshi drives Toyota Mirai to ParliamentAn FCEV, in other words, is one that uses compressed hydrogen, which combines with oxygen to power an electric motor for propulsion, as compared to the present set of electric vehicles, which run on charged batteries, primarily of lithium-ion make.But the minister did not stop at just the formal event. He drove the car all the way to Parliament, which is presently in session. “The ride was incredibly smooth, silent and comfortable and with zero emissions,” the minister remarked, “This vehicle demonstrates the transformative potential of hydrogen mobility in shaping India’s clean future.”While the electric battery vs hydrogen vs other technologies like sodium-ion has been debated about for some time, what is interesting is the competitive hues it has taken—not just down to rival technologies and companies, but whole nations.Aap chronology samajhiye. After the Second World War, transportation depended on the internal combustion engine, dominated by American companies like Ford and General Motors. The Europeans, too, had a share in the pie, particularly German brands like the Volkswagen group, which had a plethora of premium brands ranging from Porsche, BMW, Bentley and Audi.But Japan was the dark horse by the time it was the eighties and nineties, its vehicles racing to the top of the sales charts even in markets like the US, with its highly evolved market scenario and deeply insular consumers. Toyota soon became the world’s largest-selling motor car brand, while Suzuki’s Indian partnership, Maruti Suzuki, made it a heavyweight. Others like Honda, Mitsubishi, Nissan all became cars people vied for all over the world, with Brand Japan becoming numero uno in the auto sector in general, and especially in passenger cars.Then, disaster struck with the advent of electric vehicle technology. Japanese brands perhaps did not take the new technology too seriously at first, or perhaps it was China’s runaway success in EV battery technology, straddling the ecosystem right from lithium refining to battery technology to the final products. Today, 8 out of the top-selling EV cars are from China.The Japanese strategy through all this has been two-fold: one, hybrid, where we use a mix of petrol and electric or natural gas, should be the way forward at least during the transition phase. Secondly, electricity as a clean energy depends not just on its use, but also on ensuring that the source of electricity used to charge the batteries actually comes from clean sources and not from coal, as is the case primarily, for example, in India. A petrol that follows emission norms and is less polluting would do equally well.And the third, and most crucial, has been Japan’s clambering onto other future technologies, primarily Hydrogen fuel cells for now, though others like sodium ion, etc., are not anathema to them, which has made detractors wonder whether it’s a case of being miffed at the Chinese march in EV that is the real reason.Any which way, while hydrogen technology is years away from becoming commonplace. “Hydrogen fuel cell-based technology will have applications in certain areas of mobility, but I think it is a few years out for large-scale commercial applications,” argues Himanshu Aggarwal, investor & strategy of Zenergize, a power electronics company.Industry-wide, the focus is presently intensely on lithium battery EVs. “Battery electric mobility is currently the most viable pathway to decarbonise transport, driven by superior energy efficiency, declining battery costs and faster infra rollouts,” said Piyush Goyal, co-founder & CEO of Volks Energie, “Hydrogen fuel cells remain constrained by the cost and availability of green hydrogen.”The more curious thing right now is which of the options other major markets will hitch a ride on. India is officially technology or medium-agnostic, though recent government moves to cut down on the incentives for EVs, even while raising them for hybrid models (at least in some states), may hint at something else. Not to forget, the talking up of hydrogen as a promising technology, with minister Joshi’s hydrogen ride is only one example. It does make one wonder whether India is also following the Japanese playbook when it comes to dealing with a strategic rival like China.",
