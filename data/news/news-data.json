The HCOB Flash Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, reached 51.1, reflecting the highest growth in 15 months, despite persistent export weaknesses.Manufacturing displayed remarkable recovery, with PMI rates climbing to 50.5 from July's 49.8, moving into expansion territory for the first time in over three years. Although services saw slower growth, the euro zone's dominant sector still held ground with a PMI drop from 51.0 to 50.7. Germany led growth with robust manufacturing expansion.Despite positive developments, inflation pressures surged in August with input costs escalating. Service sector costs hit their peak since March, a concern for the European Central Bank, poised to possibly adjust rates in December. The ECB closely watches rising inflation as it aims for stability along with slower wage growth.",

The minister assured that state-specific legal frameworks will be respected and consultations with Northeastern states are underway.In an interview with ANI, Reddy revealed that Arunachal Pradesh has entered the auction realm for coal, and similar explorations are ongoing in Mizoram and Assam. This initiative aligns with the recent Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill 2025, which aims to curb import reliance and bolster domestic production.The government is committing to extensive mining sector reforms, including six legislative amendments. These efforts underline the strategic necessity of critical minerals—from mobile phones to aviation—while supporting India's national security goals. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has allocated 1,200 projects for nationwide exploration, while the National Critical Mineral Mission is set to run with significant funding and investments.",

    "shortDesc": "A majority of Indian consumers are expected to do most of their festive shopping online this year, with advertising playing a major role in shaping purchase decisions, according to a report by Integral Ad Science (IAS).The study conducted in July 2025 with 501 consumers reveals that festive shoppers are planning to spend an average of Rs 16,500 this year, with the majority of consumers planning to start their festive shopping before September.The study found that 82% of consumers plan to shop mainly online, with nearly one-third (31.9%) relying entirely on e-commerce. About 48% said they will buy more online than in-store, while only 2.6% plan to shop only in physical outlets. Mobile will dominate as the preferred device, with 82.6% of consumers saying they will use their phones most for festive purchases.Advertising remains central to consumer choices. According to the study, 90% of shoppers believe online ads are important in helping them discover new products and promotions. Among them, 61% called ads ‘very important’. Context also matters; 60% of consumers said ads based on their past purchases are useful, while 53% value ads placed on safe, reputable sites or those relevant to the content they are consuming.The study also highlights the growing influence of digital platforms. 69% of consumers said they will increase their use of social media for shopping, followed by 68% for video platforms like YouTube and 60% for e-commerce/retail sites. Discounts and promotions (66%) and festival-related content (63%) were identified as the biggest drivers of purchase decisions, alongside online ads (56%) and social media influencers (54%).Shopping budgets are also set to rise. About 86% of consumers said they will spend more than last year, with nearly half reporting a ‘significant increase’. At the same time, 67% plan to shop earlier to avoid high prices and 65% will pay closer attention to discounts.The report noted that impressions served alongside festive shopping content tend to spike during late November and early December. Between November 24 and December 2, impressions were up 233% compared to early November.The findings suggest that this festive season will be marked by strong online spending, with advertising, especially contextually relevant and safe placements, playing a critical role in influencing consumer behaviour.",

As part of this push, Mitra is set to inaugurate a 3,000-tonne refined flour manufacturing plant in October.“This funding is a key pillar in Mitra’s journey as we prepare for our next phase of growth. It will enable us to expand production capacity, launch new health-oriented product lines, and strengthen our presence across India and international markets,” said Abhishek Kaushik, founder and CEO of Mitra. “Our vision is to make Mitra one of the top 5 FMCG companies in India within the next 2–3 years, with a clear roadmap towards an IPO.”The startup, launched in 2023, has positioned itself in tier II and tier III cities by offering premium-quality flour under its “Chakki Fresh” methodology, a stone-grinding process designed to retain nutritional value and freshness, while keeping prices accessible.Mitra claims that its revenue has climbed from Rs 11 crore in FY24 to Rs 40 crore in FY25, with expectations to cross Rs 120 crore this year. Its distribution network currently spans over 500 distributors and 40,000 retail touchpoints. The upcoming flour plant is expected to raise monthly recurring revenue from Rs 12 crore to Rs 17 crore by November 2025. The startup is already EBITDA positive.Mitra has raised nearly Rs 25 crore to date and is preparing a Series A round in April 2026 at a targeted valuation of Rs 500 crore. Raman Sharma, Founder & CEO of Bestvantage Investments, said: “We are delighted to back Mitra in this bridge round. The FMCG sector in India is poised for significant disruption, and Mitra’s ability to blend traditional food preparation methods with modern quality standards makes it a brand with immense potential. Their growth trajectory speaks volumes of the scalability and demand for their products.”",

In addition, SMD & Co. was named as the company’s secretarial auditor for the period FY26–FY30.The leadership transition comes at a challenging time for the company. EaseMyTrip’s revenue fell 25.5% year-on-year to Rs 114 crore in the first quarter of FY26, while profit after tax plunged 98.7% to Rs 44 lakh from Rs 34 crore a year earlier.In January, Nishant Pitti stepped down as chief executive, with Rikant Pitti taking over as CEO. On Friday, the company said both Nishant and Rikant have voluntarily chosen to forgo their salaries temporarily to underscore alignment with shareholder interests and reinforce confidence in EaseMyTrip’s long-term growth prospects.",

    "title": "GST Council Meeting Clears Dual Tax Slabs Of 5%, 18% Implementation From Sept 22: Report",
    "shortDesc": "The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, at its 56th meeting chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, has approved a dual tax structure of 5 per cent and 18 per cent, replacing the existing four-rate system. The new regime, which removes the 12 per cent and 18 per cent slabs, will come into effect from September 22, as per sources cited by news agency ANI.According to West Bengal Finance Minister, the rationalisation will lead to an overall revenue loss of ₹47,700 crore. The meeting, which began on September 3 and concludes on September 4, deliberated on easing compliance and lowering taxes on essential goods to stimulate consumption amid global trade headwinds.News agency PTI reported that the Council discussed reducing GST on insurance premiums, rationalising footwear and apparel duties, and streamlining compliance with faster refund timelines. A special 40 per cent rate for luxury items such as high-end cars, tobacco and cigarettes also remains under consideration.Items Set to Get CheaperDaily-use goods such as butter, ghee, jam, dry fruits, biscuits, pastry, ice cream, namkeen, bottled water, fruit juices and beverages containing milk are expected to shift to the lower 5 per cent slab from the current 18 per cent. Similarly, footwear and apparel priced up to ₹2,500 will now attract 5 per cent GST, up from the earlier ₹1,000 threshold.Consumer goods including feeding bottles, kitchenware, bicycles, umbrellas and bamboo furniture may also see reduced tax rates. In addition, items like toothpaste, shampoo, soap and hair oil could drop from 18 per cent to 5 per cent. Cement, meanwhile, is set to become cheaper with GST lowered from 28 per cent to 18 per cent.On the other hand, garments and footwear above ₹2,500 will now attract 18 per cent GST, while high-end automobiles, motorcycles above 350 cc, yachts and private aircraft are under discussion for the steep 40 per cent slab.States Voice Concerns Over LossesWhile the Centre projects that GST reforms could boost growth by up to 0.5 percentage points in the medium term, several opposition-ruled states have flagged concerns over revenue erosion. Ahead of the Council meet, ministers from Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and West Bengal convened separately to push for a compensation framework.Himachal Pradesh Minister Rajesh Dharmani told news agency ANI, \"Unanimously, everyone has agreed in favour of GST rate rationalisation. Now there will be three slabs. Effectively, it will be 5% and 18% percent. 12% and 28% have been abolished. There will be 40% on luxury goods.\"Jharkhand Finance Minister Radhakrishna Kishore said his state could lose ₹2,000 crore annually under the revised structure. “If the Centre agrees to compensate us for whatever loss we would incur, then we have no issues in approving the agenda before the Council. I don’t think the issue will come up for voting, as in a federal structure, it is the responsibility of the Centre to compensate states for revenue loss,” Kishore told reporters.In a press statement, he further said, “Jharkhand is a manufacturing state. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) system has adversely affected the state’s internal revenue collection.” He noted that between 2017 and 2024-25, the state has already lost ₹16,408 crore in revenue, with the figure expected to rise to nearly ₹61,670 crore by 2029.Kishore emphasised that “around 75 to 80 per cent of coal and steel production from Jharkhand is consumed outside the state. Thus, the benefits of GST are accruing to consumer states.” He urged the Centre to provide a guaranteed minimum of ₹2,000 crore annually until Jharkhand’s revenue stabilises.",

    "shortDesc": "Bangladesh has become Asia’s most active buyer of spot LNG cargoes – an unlikely new heavyweight in one of the world’s most volatile energy markets. Once largely self-sufficient in natural gas, the country now leans heavily on imported fuel to keep its factories running and its power sector alive. The shift is dramatic: gas still meets 43% of Bangladesh’s total energy needs, but domestic production is falling, reserves are dwindling, and the gap is being filled at a soaring cost. What began as a stopgap after shortages in 2017–18 has snowballed into structural dependence, pushing Bangladesh into the spotlight of the global LNG trade – and exposing the financial and systemic weaknesses that brought it there. * Bangladesh has become Asia’s most active spot LNG buyer as domestic gas output falls and demand rises. * Long-term deals with Qatar and Oman cover only part of the gap, so spot imports have surged. * Reliance on spot LNG is creating financial and energy-security risks. Domestic production peaked at 27 bcm/y in 2018, but will have slipped to 20 bcm/y by 2025. Consumption, meanwhile, was at 29 bcm/y in 2025 and is forecast to rise even higher. The shortfall is widening, and [...]The post Bangladesh Becomes LNG’s Hottest Story appeared first on Energy Bangla.",

    "shortDesc": "Kavin Bharti Mittal, son of Airtel's Sunil Bharti Mittal, said his 13-year-old startup Hike would close down entirely, marking the end of a company once touted as India’s answer to WhatsApp. The decision follows the government’s recent ban on real-money gaming (RMG), a regulatory move that has upended business models across the gaming sector.In a post on LinkedIn, Mittal, founder and CEO of Hike, said that while the firm’s US business had shown early traction since launching nine months ago, continuing operations globally would require a full recapitalisation. “After the India ban, scaling globally would require a full recap, a reset that is not the best use of capital or time,” he wrote.Hike has about $4 million left on its balance sheet, which will be used for vendor payments and employee severance, with any remaining funds returned to investors.Founded in 2012 as a messaging app, Hike at its peak boasted more than 100 million users before shutting down Hike Messenger in 2021. The company later pivoted into gaming and Web3, launching two products: Vibe, a community platform, and Rush, a real-money gaming service that scaled to 10 million users and generated $500 million in gross revenue over four years. Despite those gains, Mittal said recurring tax disputes, regulatory battles, and now the RMG ban made continuation untenable.“RMG was never the destination. It was a means to prove unit economics and unlock the bigger vision. But we got locked into the Indian market in a tax/regulation battle,” he told investors. “For the first time in 13 years, my answer is no. Not for me, not for my team, and not for our investors.”Hike had raised about $261 million from Tiger Global, Tencent, and Bharti Enterprises, among others. Mittal noted that while the shutdown was a disappointment, the lessons and networks built through Hike would inform his next chapter. He pointed to emerging opportunities in artificial intelligence, energy, and other frontier technologies.The closure underscores a broader reckoning in India’s gaming industry following the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act 2025. Several players, including Mobile Premier League and WinZO, have scaled back or reoriented their strategies, while startups such as Zupee and Probo have seen their business models disrupted.“This chapter ends, but the climb continues,” Mittal wrote, framing the decision not as a defeat but as a reset.",

    "title": "Gameskraft lays off 120 employees weeks after the ban on real-money gaming",
    "shortDesc": "India’s gaming sector is facing a severe shake-up in the wake of the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Act, 2025, with Bengaluru-based Gameskraft becoming the latest casualty.The company on Thursday confirmed that it has suspended operations entirely and begun a sweeping restructuring exercise that includes laying off about 120 employees.The move comes just weeks after Parliament passed the new law banning online real-money gaming. Policymakers have defended the ban as a safeguard against addiction and financial losses, while industry leaders warn that it risks driving users towards unregulated offshore platforms.Founded in 2017, Gameskraft grew into one of India’s largest online gaming companies with offerings across card games, casual titles, and real-money formats. But the regulatory framework, along with rising compliance obligations and tax burdens, has left the company unable to continue its business.“Despite our best efforts, the current regulatory landscape has made us completely stop our business and has left us with no choice but to initiate a company-wide restructuring,” the company told employees in a note.The layoffs affect multiple teams and functions, with the company warning that further structural changes may follow. Founder and CEO Prithvi Singh called the decision “one of the most difficult” in Gameskraft’s journey, emphasising that it was driven by the external environment rather than employee performance.The announcement comes at a time when Gameskraft is already battling internal turmoil. Earlier this month, the company accused former CFO Ramesh Prabhu of siphoning off Rs 270.43 crore over nearly five years through personal trading in futures and options. The case is under police investigation.Despite the crisis, the company has announced an extensive support package for affected staff. This includes medical insurance coverage until March 2026, continuation of wellness and health services through May 2026, the option to convert group policies into individual plans, leave encashment based on full salary, and priority rehiring if Gameskraft pivots into new business areas. Outplacement assistance, referrals, and recommendation letters will also be provided.",
