The HCOB Flash Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by S&P Global, reached 51.1, reflecting the highest growth in 15 months, despite persistent export weaknesses.Manufacturing displayed remarkable recovery, with PMI rates climbing to 50.5 from July's 49.8, moving into expansion territory for the first time in over three years. Although services saw slower growth, the euro zone's dominant sector still held ground with a PMI drop from 51.0 to 50.7. Germany led growth with robust manufacturing expansion.Despite positive developments, inflation pressures surged in August with input costs escalating. Service sector costs hit their peak since March, a concern for the European Central Bank, poised to possibly adjust rates in December. The ECB closely watches rising inflation as it aims for stability along with slower wage growth.",

The minister assured that state-specific legal frameworks will be respected and consultations with Northeastern states are underway.In an interview with ANI, Reddy revealed that Arunachal Pradesh has entered the auction realm for coal, and similar explorations are ongoing in Mizoram and Assam. This initiative aligns with the recent Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill 2025, which aims to curb import reliance and bolster domestic production.The government is committing to extensive mining sector reforms, including six legislative amendments. These efforts underline the strategic necessity of critical minerals—from mobile phones to aviation—while supporting India's national security goals. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has allocated 1,200 projects for nationwide exploration, while the National Critical Mineral Mission is set to run with significant funding and investments.",
