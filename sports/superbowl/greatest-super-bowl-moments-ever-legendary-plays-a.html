With seconds left, Norwood’s kick sailed just wide right, sealing a Giants victory and delivering one of the most agonizing moments in Super Bowl history[1]. The phrase "wide right" remains synonymous with heartbreak for Bills fans.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Adam Vinatieri’s Game-Winning Kick: Super Bowl XXXVI</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">With the score tied and only seconds left, Adam Vinatieri calmly nailed a 48-yard field goal to give the underdog New England Patriots their first Super Bowl win.

The play immediately became a symbol of creative risk-taking and underdog triumph[2][4].</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Helmet Catch: David Tyree in Super Bowl XLII</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Trailing the undefeated New England Patriots, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning escaped a near sack and heaved a desperation pass.

This stop—known simply as <strong>"The Tackle"</strong>—preserved the Rams’ victory and remains one of the greatest defensive plays ever seen on the Super Bowl stage[3][4].</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Lynn Swann’s Circus Catches: Super Bowl X</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Pittsburgh Steelers receiver Lynn Swann dazzled with acrobatic, almost balletic catches, including a leaping 53-yard grab. Swann’s performance, totaling 161 yards and a touchdown, helped the Steelers win and set a new Super Bowl record at the time[4].</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Montana to Taylor: The Latest Game-Winning TD</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">In Super Bowl XXIII, Joe Montana led the San Francisco 49ers on a legendary 92-yard drive, capping it with a touchdown pass to John Taylor with just 34 seconds left.
