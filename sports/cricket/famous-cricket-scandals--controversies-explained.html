    Cricket, often celebrated as a gentlemanâ€™s game, has not been immune to scandals and controversies that have shaken its integrity. From high-profile match-fixing to pitch tampering, the sport has seen turbulent times that forced fans and governing bodies to confront uncomfortable realities. This article explores some of the most infamous cricket scandals, the players at the heart of them, and their lasting impact on the game.

    No discussion of cricket scandals is complete without mentioning the <strong>Hansie Cronje affair</strong>. In 2000, South African captain Hansie Cronje was accused of fixing One Day Internationals against India, following a Delhi Police sting operation. Cronje initially denied wrongdoing, but mounting evidence, including testimonies from teammates, led him to confess. The scandal expanded as Cronje implicated other players, including Indiaâ€™s <strong>Mohammad Azharuddin</strong> and Pakistanâ€™s <strong>Saleem Malik</strong>, both of whom received life bans. Cronjeâ€™s admission sent shockwaves through the cricketing world, tarnishing the sportâ€™s reputation and prompting stricter anti-corruption measures. Tragically, Cronje died in a plane crash in 2002, which itself became a topic of speculation and conspiracy theories.<br/>

</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Pakistanâ€™s Spot-Fixing Scandal (2010)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    In 2010, cricket was rocked again when Pakistani players <strong>Mohammad Amir</strong>, <strong>Mohammad Asif</strong>, and <strong>Salman Butt</strong> were convicted of spot-fixing during a Test match against England. Undercover journalists revealed that the players would deliberately bowl no-balls at specific moments, allowing gamblers to profit. The trio was banned and sentenced to prison terms, marking one of the most public and damaging episodes in cricket history. This scandal demonstrated how technology and media could expose corruption, but also how vulnerable players were to illicit approaches.<br/>

</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The IPL Spot-Fixing Crisis (2013)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The Indian Premier League (IPL) has delivered both dazzling entertainment and dramatic controversy. In 2013, players including <strong>Sreesanth</strong> from Rajasthan Royals were arrested for accepting money to underperform in matches. The scandal involved not just players, but also team owners and bookies, exposing the deep-rooted issues of illegal betting and match manipulation in franchise cricket. Though many were later acquitted, the episode led to greater scrutiny and reforms in the IPL.<br/>

</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Sri Lanka Pitch Tampering Allegations (2018)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    While match-fixing often gets headlines, pitch tampering is a more subtle but equally damaging form of manipulation. In 2018, an Al Jazeera investigation alleged that pitch conditions at Sri Lankaâ€™s Galle stadium were being altered to favor certain outcomes during matches against Australia and India. The scandal involved former players, groundsmen, and fixers, and raised concerns about the integrity of match preparations. The ICC investigated, and the English Cricket Board considered canceling a tour over fears of unfair play.<br/>

</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Other Notable Scandals</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Cricketâ€™s history is dotted with many other controversies, including bans and allegations against players like <strong>Ajay Jadeja</strong>, <strong>Herschelle Gibbs</strong>, <strong>Marlon Samuels</strong>, and <strong>Lonwabo Tsotsobe</strong>. These cases, ranging from accepting bribes to sharing insider information, highlight the ongoing battle between corrupt influences and the sportâ€™s guardians. Despite efforts to educate players and enforce anti-corruption codes, the lure of easy money remains a persistent threat.<br/>

</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Why Do These Scandals Happen?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The enormous popularity of cricket, combined with unregulated betting markets, creates fertile ground for corruption. Financial pressures, career uncertainties, and the promise of huge rewards can tempt players into illegal activities. Governing bodies now invest heavily in player education, surveillance, and enforcement, but the challenge is ongoing. Scandals serve as cautionary tales and reminders that the spirit of cricket must be vigilantly protected.
