Cricket isn’t just a battle of skill and strategy—it's also a game woven through with superstition. From lucky charms to repetitive rituals, cricketers, like athletes in many sports, cling to routines that promise a little extra luck or peace of mind. These habits can seem quirky (or even downright bizarre) to outsiders, but for players under pressure, they offer comfort, confidence, and sometimes, a psychological edge.

If you peek inside a cricket dressing room before a big match, you’ll likely spot players meticulously strapping on their left pad first. This ritual is so prevalent that it’s become almost sacred among cricketers worldwide. For many, it began as a harmless habit—putting on the left pad first on a day they scored big—and soon turned into a superstition too important to break. If the sequence is interrupted, players often blame any poor performance on the disruption, not technique or conditions. Even those who claim not to be superstitious often find themselves sticking to this routine, just in case <a href="https://mysterycricket.com/blogs/the-mystery-cricket-blog/weirdest-superstitions-in-cricket-dressing-rooms" target="_blank">[4]</a>.

Australian legend Steve Waugh is synonymous with grit—and superstition. Throughout his career, Waugh carried a red handkerchief in his pocket, a gift from his grandmother. Over time, it transcended its sentimental value and became his lucky charm. He credits the simple red rag with grounding him during the game's most intense moments, offering a source of comfort and confidence when nerves threatened to take over <a href="https://cricketeer.uk/2025/03/05/10-quirky-cricket-superstitions/" target="_blank">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.sportsadda.com/cricket/features/wickets-and-wacky-rituals-exposing-cricket-stars-and-their-superstitions/" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="https://blog.pitchero.com/7-of-crickets-craziest-superstitions" target="_blank">[5]</a>.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Sachin Tendulkar’s Precise Habits</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
Arguably cricket’s greatest icon, Sachin Tendulkar, followed a strict pre-match routine: left pad first, always. He downplayed it as a "habit," but, like many superstitions, it became a sacred part of his preparation. Tendulkar was also known for adjusting his gloves before every ball—a gesture that became as famous as his batting prowess. For him, these rituals formed part of a mental framework for focus and composure <a href="https://www.sportsadda.com/cricket/features/wickets-and-wacky-rituals-exposing-cricket-stars-and-their-superstitions/" target="_blank">[3]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqQl4JjTzUQ" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Lucky Charms: Beyond Pads and Handkerchiefs</h2><p class="image-credit">
Cricketers often carry personal lucky charms. Zaheer Khan, the Indian fast bowler, is known for his yellow handkerchief that makes a match-day appearance only in crucial games. Other players swear by lucky undergarments, specific bats that must not be changed mid-tournament, or even wristbands and necklaces. England’s Michael Vaughan, for instance, carried the same coin for every toss during the 2005 Ashes, crediting it for his team’s run of good luck <a href="https://blog.pitchero.com/7-of-crickets-craziest-superstitions" target="_blank">[5]</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqQl4JjTzUQ" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Numerology and Ritual Numbers</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
Numbers hold a special sway over some players. Cricket stars like MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh sport their favorite numbers on their shirts for luck. England’s Stuart Broad prefers to do things in threes—scratching his batting mark three times, bowling three imaginary balls before his run-up, and so on. These rituals are believed to create a sense of order and control in an unpredictable sport <a href="https://blog.pitchero.com/7-of-crickets-craziest-superstitions" target="_blank">[5]</a>.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Pre-Ball Rituals: Gloves, Bats, and Focus</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
Watch closely before a bowler delivers or a batter faces the next ball, and you’ll spot a host of micro-rituals. Some tap the pitch a set number of times, others adjust their helmet or gloves, and a few touch their equipment in a specific sequence. For Steve Smith, his elaborate pre-delivery routine—fidgeting, shuffling, and marking his guard—serves as both a calming mechanism and a mental reset, shutting out distractions and dialing in focus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqQl4JjTzUQ" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Psychology Behind Cricket Superstitions</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
Why do even the world’s best athletes buy into these rituals? Sports psychologists say superstitions help players handle the intense pressure and uncertainty that comes with elite sport. Rituals and lucky charms create a sense of control and confidence—even if the logic is questionable. The belief alone is often enough to sharpen mental focus and boost performance. As one researcher put it: “What they’re really doing is giving themselves confidence. If I do these little rituals, then I’m gonna feel confident going into this activity, and I can succeed and do well” <a href="https://cricketeer.uk/2025/03/05/10-quirky-cricket-superstitions/" target="_blank">[2]</a>.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Are Superstitions Harmful or Harmless?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
Most experts view these superstitions as harmless—unless they become compulsive or interfere with performance. In fact, for many players, they’re just part of the colorful fabric of cricket culture. Whether they actually influence the outcome is up for debate, but their psychological impact is very real. At the end of the day, if a red rag or a left pad first can calm the nerves or inspire a match-winning knock, who’s to argue?
