<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">Greatest Innings in Cricket History</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Cricket has always been a stage for extraordinary feats and spellbinding moments. Among these, certain individual innings have stood out—not just for the sheer volume of runs, but for the audacity, context, and impact on the game. In this article, we revisit some of the greatest innings in cricket history, reliving iconic performances that have defined and redefined the sport.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Brian Lara’s 400* – Test Cricket’s Everest</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">When discussing cricket’s most monumental innings, <b>Brian Lara’s unbeaten 400</b> against England in 2004 is impossible to overlook. In a game where patience, endurance, and mental strength are tested to their limits, Lara's record-breaking knock for the West Indies became the highest individual score in Test cricket—a record that stands tall to this day. Over two days, Lara showcased impeccable technique and unyielding focus, guiding his team to a mountainous total and etching his name into cricketing folklore.<br/>
This innings was not just about the numbers; it was a masterclass in domination and resilience, achieved when most modern teams rarely allow batters to settle for so long due to the push for results and declarations.<a href="#source1">[1]</a><a href="#source2">[2]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Rohit Sharma’s 264 – ODI Brilliance Redefined</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">In the fast-paced world of One Day Internationals, few innings have left as indelible a mark as <b>Rohit Sharma’s 264</b> against Sri Lanka in 2014. Facing a formidable bowling attack, Sharma’s knock was a blend of patience early on and an explosive flurry of boundaries in the latter stages. His innings, still the highest individual score in ODI cricket, was a showcase of timing, power, and effortless strokeplay that left fans and opponents stunned.<br/>
No player has come close to this awe-inspiring feat, making Sharma’s marathon effort one of the most celebrated achievements in the format.<a href="#source4">[4]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Chris Gayle’s 175* – The T20 Tornado</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"><b>Chris Gayle</b> is synonymous with T20 fireworks, but even by his standards, his unbeaten 175 for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2013 IPL was a spectacle beyond belief. Facing Pune Warriors India, Gayle bludgeoned his way to the highest individual T20 score ever, smashing 17 sixes and 13 fours in just 66 balls. The innings not only set new benchmarks for power-hitting but also redefined what was possible in the shortest format of the game.<br/>
With T20 cricket evolving rapidly and bowlers constantly adapting, Gayle’s record seems almost untouchable.<a href="#source2">[2]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Graham Gooch’s 456 Runs in a Single Test Match</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Sometimes, greatness is measured not in a single innings but across an entire match. <b>Graham Gooch</b> achieved this rare distinction in 1990 against India, amassing a combined 456 runs—333 in the first innings and 123 in the second. Gooch’s Herculean effort remains the most runs ever scored by a player in a single Test match, a testament to his fitness and unrelenting concentration.<a href="#source2">[2]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Herschelle Gibbs’ 175 – The Perfect Chase</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Few ODI chases come close to the drama of the 2006 clash between South Africa and Australia at the Wanderers. <b>Herschelle Gibbs</b> produced one of the greatest ODI innings, smashing 175 runs and leading his team to a world-record chase of 434. Gibbs’ fearless strokeplay under pressure turned the impossible into reality, making this knock one of the most entertaining and courageous in cricket history.<a href="#source5">[5]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Sachin Tendulkar’s 200* – A Milestone for the Ages</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Cricket is incomplete without mentioning the “Master Blaster.” <b>Sachin Tendulkar</b> became the first man to score a double century in ODIs, achieving the milestone against South Africa in 2010. Tendulkar’s innings was celebrated not just for its statistical significance but for the manner in which it was constructed—with elegance, precision, and a sense of inevitability that only the truly great possess.<a href="#source3">[3]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Innings That Shaped the Game</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">While these knocks are etched in record books, cricket’s beauty lies in its ability to surprise and inspire. Every era has witnessed innings that have defined careers, won hearts, and shifted the balance of matches and even series. Whether through sheer volume, situational brilliance, or audacious strokeplay, these innings remain timeless reminders of what makes cricket the fascinating spectacle it is today.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Watch: Greatest Individual Innings in Cricket (Video)</h2><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="blog-video" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JtTuUPeQ88M" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 100%;" width="560"></iframe><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Sources</h2><ul>
