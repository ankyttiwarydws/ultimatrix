Yet, India's most famous hill stationsâ€”Shimla, Ooty, Manaliâ€”are often crowded, especially during peak seasons. If you long for the cool mountain air but crave peace, India offers many lesser-known hill retreats, rich in tranquility, natural beauty, and authentic local experiences.

Trek to <em>Tiger Falls</em>â€”one of the highest in Indiaâ€”explore the mysterious <em>Budher Caves</em>, or simply soak in the cool, pine-scented breeze.
