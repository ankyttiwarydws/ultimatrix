<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">The Most Beautiful Beaches in Goa Beyond Baga &amp; Calangute</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">When you think of Goa, chances are that the lively shores of <strong>Baga</strong> and <strong>Calangute</strong> come to mind. These iconic beaches are famous for their nightlife, water sports, and bustling crowds. But thereâ€™s much more to Goaâ€™s coastline than these popular hotspots. For travelers seeking tranquility, natural beauty, and authentic Goan vibes, several lesser-known beaches await discovery. Hereâ€™s a guide to the most beautiful beaches in Goa beyond Baga and Calangute.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Morjim Beach: Where Nature Meets Serenity</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"><strong>Morjim Beach</strong> is often called "Little Russia" due to its popularity with Russian tourists, but its true charm lies in its serene atmosphere and ecological importance. It's best known as the nesting ground for the endangered Olive Ridley turtles, and conservation efforts ensure their safe return each year. The beach offers wide, clean sands, gentle waves, and a peaceful environment, making it perfect for relaxing sunsets, birdwatching, and walks along the Chapora River. Surf schools and kite surfing add a dash of adventure for thrill-seekers, but overall, Morjim remains a tranquil escape from the crowds.<br/>
