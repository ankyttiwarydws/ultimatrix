<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">GTA 5 Big Score Heist: Best Approach to Choose</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Few moments in gaming are as exhilarating as planning and executing the Big Score Heist in <strong>GTA 5</strong>. As the climax of the story mode, this mission is your chance to secure the largest payout in Los Santosâ€”if you make the right choices. This guide breaks down the two approaches, reveals the optimal crew for each, and explains why your selections matter for maximizing both your experience and your earnings.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Understanding the Big Score Heist Approaches</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">When Lester assembles Michael, Franklin, and Trevor for the grand finale, youâ€™re given two distinct ways to rob the Union Depository Bank:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Subtle Approach</strong>: An elaborate plan involving disguises, a decoy convoy, and hacking, aiming to avoid direct confrontation.</li>
<li><strong>Obvious Approach</strong>: A high-octane, guns-blazing assaultâ€”drilling straight into the vault, fighting off waves of law enforcement, and orchestrating a dramatic gold-lift via helicopter.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Subtle vs. Obvious: Which Approach Is Best?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">While both options are entertaining and challenging, most veteran players and expert analyses recommend selecting the <strong>Obvious approach</strong>â€”especially if your goal is to maximize profit and minimize complications.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Obvious Approach Advantages:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher payout</strong>: No need for expensive vehicle upgrades or hefty bribes.</li>
<li><strong>Less risk of losing money</strong>: Fewer moving parts and more control over key crew members.</li>
<li><strong>More action-packed</strong>: Satisfies players who enjoy intense shootouts and dramatic escapes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Subtle Approach Drawbacks:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Requires a bribe of $300,000 and costly vehicle upgrades.</li>
<li>Relies on a bigger, more expensive crew.</li>
<li>Potential for mistakes that can reduce your final take.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Choosing <strong>Obvious</strong> consistently results in the highest possible payout and is generally more forgiving for first-time players looking for the most bang for their buck<strong>[1][2][3]</strong>.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Best Crew Choices for Maximum Profit</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Your crew selection is just as important as the approach. Each member takes a percentage of the loot, so picking the right mix of skill and low commission is key. Hereâ€™s the optimal crew for the Obvious approach:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Driver 1 (Helicopter):</strong> <strong>Taliana Martinez</strong> (5%) â€” Highly skilled, reliable, and takes the smallest cut. If you havenâ€™t unlocked her, consider doing her random event before the heist.</li>
<li><strong>Driver 2 (Train):</strong> <strong>Karim Denz</strong> (8%) â€” Sufficiently skilled for driving the train. If heâ€™s inexperienced, always assign him to the train, not the helicopter, to avoid costly mistakes.</li>
<li><strong>Gunman 1:</strong> <strong>Daryl Johns</strong> (6%) â€” Cheap and skilled enough for the task.</li>
<li><strong>Gunman 2:</strong> <strong>Norm Richards</strong> or <strong>Hugh Welsh</strong> (7%) â€” Both are affordable; pick the one with more experience if available.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">This crew combination ensures you donâ€™t lose gold during the mission and keeps total crew cuts to a minimum, maximizing each protagonistâ€™s share<strong>[2][3][4]</strong>.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Big Score Payout Breakdown</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">With the best crew and the Obvious approach, your expected earnings are as follows:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Gross Take:</strong> $201,600,000</li>
<li><strong>Lester's Cut (12%):</strong> $24,192,000</li>
<li><strong>Crew Cut (26%):</strong> $52,416,000</li>
<li><strong>Michael, Franklin, Trevor (each):</strong> $41,664,000</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Choosing more expensive or less skilled crew members can drastically reduce your take or even result in lost gold during the getaway. Avoid using Karim Denz for the helicopter if heâ€™s not experienced, as he may crash and lose half the score<strong>[2][3]</strong>.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How to Unlock Taliana Martinez</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"><strong>Taliana Martinez</strong> is not immediately available. To unlock her, look for her random event in the northern countrysideâ€”sheâ€™s injured on the side of the road after a car accident. Rescue and deliver her safely to her destination, and sheâ€™ll become available as a driver for your heists. Her low cut and high skill make her the best choice every time<strong>[3][4]</strong>.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Step-by-Step: Obvious Approach Mission Flow</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Hereâ€™s what to expect when executing the Obvious approach:</p><ul>
<li>Drive to the Union Depository Bank.</li>
<li>Drill through the wall to access the vault directly.</li>
<li>Plant explosives and breach the vault doors.</li>
<li>Defend your position against NOOSE teams (special police units).</li>
<li>Transfer gold to the helicopter and train.</li>
<li>Evade law enforcement and lose your wanted level.</li>
<li>Drop the gold onto the train and escape to safety.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">With the right players and approach, youâ€™ll walk away from the biggest heist in <strong>GTA 5</strong> with a legendary payday and a satisfying conclusion to your criminal saga<strong>[2][3][4]</strong>.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Watch: Best Crew &amp; Approach for The Big Score (MAX Payout)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">For a visual walkthrough, check out this recent, popular YouTube guide detailing step-by-step crew selection and approach tips:</p><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="blog-video" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWOP2RdgosA" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 100%;" width="560"></iframe><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"><strong>Q: Can I replay the heist to try both approaches?</strong><br/>
  A: Yes, after finishing the story, you can replay The Big Score and experiment with both the Subtle and Obvious approaches.</p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"><strong>Q: What happens if I pick inexperienced or expensive crew members?</strong><br/>
  A: Inexperienced members can cause costly mistakes, such as losing gold during the escape. Expensive members take a higher cut, reducing your final payout.</p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"><strong>Q: Is there any story difference between Subtle and Obvious?</strong><br/>
  A: The story outcome is mostly the same, but the missionâ€™s tone and gameplay varyâ€”Obvious is more action-packed, while Subtle emphasizes stealth and planning.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Sources</h2><ul>
