    The Paleto Score is one of the most action-packed and memorable heists in <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> (GTA 5), bringing Michael, Trevor, and Franklin together for a wild small-town bank robbery that escalates into an all-out battle with law enforcement. If youâ€™re aiming for that elusive Gold Medal or just want to survive the chaos, this detailed guide will walk you through every step of the mission, offering strategies, tips, and key details to maximize your rewards.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Mission Overview: The Paleto Score</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The Paleto Score is the 46th main story mission in GTA 5, set in the quiet fishing village of Paleto Bay. Orchestrated by Lester Crest, this heist involves all three protagonists and serves as the finale of one of the game's main heist arcs. The goal? Rob the well-guarded bank and make it out alive, facing escalating waves of police and military resistance along the way.<br/>
    For 100% completion, youâ€™ll need to complete specific objectives, but the mission is a blast even if youâ€™re just playing for the story.<a href="#source1">[1]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How to Start the Paleto Score</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Before the actual heist, youâ€™ll need to complete the <em>Paleto Score Setup</em> mission. This involves hijacking military-grade equipment and prepping your crew. Once ready, head to the pier in Paleto Bay to trigger the main event.<a href="#source4">[4]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the mission objectives and how to tackle them:
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Go to the pier:</strong> Drive your crew to the starting location in Paleto Bay.</li>
<li><strong>Park the van near the bank entrance:</strong> Position the getaway vehicle for a fast exit.</li>
<li><strong>Enter the bank:</strong> Head inside and approach the vault with your crew.</li>
<li><strong>Take out the cops:</strong> After tripping the alarm, prepare for a fierce shootout with local police. Use cover and Trevorâ€™s minigun for maximum firepower.</li>
<li><strong>Take out the helicopter:</strong> Watch for a police chopper and shoot it down quickly before it can pin you down.</li>
<li><strong>Shoot the fence down:</strong> Blast your way out of the bankâ€™s back exit by destroying the fence with heavy weapons.</li>
<li><strong>Hold off the military:</strong> As reinforcements arrive, keep moving and use explosive weapons to create chaos and clear a path.</li>
<li><strong>Regroup with Michael and Trevor:</strong> Stay close to your team to avoid being overwhelmed.</li>
<li><strong>Escape to the factory:</strong> Push through the final waves of resistance and reach the factory.</li>
<li><strong>Head to the railway platform:</strong> The final leg of the escape involves reaching the train tracks.</li>
<li><strong>Get on the train:</strong> Board the train with your crew to complete the heist.<a href="#source1">[1]</a></li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Gold Medal Objectives &amp; Tips</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    To earn the coveted Gold Medal for The Paleto Score, you need to complete the following objectives. Each can be achieved across multiple playthroughs, so donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t nail them all in one go.<a href="#source1">[1]</a>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Let it Rain:</strong> Fire over 4,000 bullets. Use Trevorâ€™s minigun liberally during the shootouts.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Finish with at least 50% shooting accuracy. Focus on body shots and leverage Michaelâ€™s slow-motion ability for precision.</li>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> Complete the mission in under 16 minutes. Skip cutscenes and keep moving during firefights.</li>
<li><strong>Collateral Damage:</strong> Cause at least $1,000,000 in property damage. Blow up vehicles, shoot gas pumps, and destroy the gas station for maximum destruction.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If youâ€™re struggling with these objectives, replay the mission and focus on one or two goals at a time. Progress is cumulative, so you donâ€™t have to get all objectives in a single run.<a href="#source3">[3]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Best Strategies for Each Character</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Trevor:</strong> Use his minigun and rage ability to mow down cops and vehicles, especially when you need to rack up bullet counts and collateral damage.<br/>
<strong>Michael:</strong> Activate his bullet-time skill during intense firefights, especially when accuracy is important.<br/>
<strong>Franklin:</strong> While less critical in this mission, keep him mobile and use his driving skills during the escape sequence if needed.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2><ul>
<li>Standing still during shootouts â€” always stay on the move to avoid getting flanked.</li>
<li>Forgetting to use explosives for collateral damage â€” grenades and RPGs help quickly rack up destruction.</li>
<li>Ignoring helicopters â€” take them down ASAP to prevent being pinned down.</li>
<li>Not replaying for medals â€” remember, Gold Medal objectives are cumulative!</li>
