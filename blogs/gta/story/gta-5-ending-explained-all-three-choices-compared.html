<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">GTA 5 Ending Explained: All Three Choices Compared</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Grand Theft Auto V’s story reaches its climax with a fateful decision: Franklin Clinton, one of the game’s three protagonists, must choose how the criminal saga ends. Players are given three distinct options—kill Trevor, kill Michael, or take on a suicidal “Deathwish” mission with both. Each ending dramatically shapes the fate of Los Santos’ most infamous trio and leaves players reflecting on loyalty, betrayal, and justice. Let’s break down what each choice means, what happens, and which ending is considered canonical.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Setup: The Final Choice</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    After the high-stakes Union Depository heist, Franklin returns home only to be confronted by two powerful antagonists: Steve Haines of the FIB and billionaire Devin Weston. Haines wants Trevor dead, seeing him as dangerously unpredictable, while Weston demands Michael’s death as revenge for a botched hit on his lawyer. Faced with these demands—and the threat looming over his own life—Franklin is given three choices:
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Kill Trevor</strong></li>
<li><strong>Kill Michael</strong></li>
<li><strong>Deathwish</strong>—team up with both friends and confront all enemies</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Ending A: Kill Trevor (“Something Sensible”)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    If Franklin chooses to kill Trevor, he lures him to a secluded location under the pretense of a meeting. Sensing betrayal, Trevor flees, triggering a dramatic car chase. Michael joins the pursuit and ultimately causes Trevor’s vehicle to crash into an oil tanker, leaving Trevor soaked in gasoline. Franklin then shoots, igniting the fuel and killing Trevor in a fiery explosion. The bond between Franklin and Michael remains strained but intact, while Trevor’s chaotic presence is removed from the city’s criminal underworld <a href="https://screenrant.com/grand-theft-auto-5-ending-options-explained-a-b-c/" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
  </p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Consequences:</strong> Trevor’s death removes the most unpredictable character, but it leaves Franklin and Michael with lingering guilt. Trevor’s fans consider this ending the most tragic, as he is arguably the most loyal of the trio <a href="https://gamerant.com/grand-theft-auto-5-endings-explained-ending-a-b-c/" target="_blank">[3]</a>.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Ending B: Kill Michael (“The Time’s Come”)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Choosing to kill Michael leads Franklin to set up a meeting with his mentor. The encounter quickly devolves into a chase, ending atop a power plant. After a tense confrontation, Franklin pushes Michael from the ledge—players can either save him or let him fall, but either way, Michael dies. Trevor, devastated by Michael’s murder, cuts ties with Franklin, leaving Franklin rich but alone in the aftermath <a href="https://screenrant.com/grand-theft-auto-5-ending-options-explained-a-b-c/" target="_blank">[1]</a>.
  </p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Consequences:</strong> Franklin loses both of his allies, and Michael’s family is left bereft. This ending is often seen as the coldest, as Franklin betrays his mentor and the man who brought him into the criminal fold <a href="https://gamerant.com/grand-theft-auto-5-endings-explained-ending-a-b-c/" target="_blank">[3]</a>.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Ending C: Deathwish (“The Third Way”)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The “Deathwish” option is unique: Franklin refuses to betray either friend. Instead, with Lester’s help, he devises a plan to eliminate their enemies in one final, explosive confrontation. Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and Lamar join forces to take down Steve Haines, Devin Weston, Wei Cheng, and other adversaries. With all threats neutralized, the three protagonists agree to go their separate ways, alive and free <a href="https://eurogamer.net/gta-5-last-mission-kill-trevor-michael-or-deathwish-8026" target="_blank">[2]</a>.
  </p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Consequences:</strong> All three protagonists survive, and the player can continue exploring Los Santos with each character. While none of them face justice for their crimes, this ending is the most optimistic and is considered the canonical ending by most fans and Rockstar Games, especially due to events in GTA Online <a href="https://gamerant.com/grand-theft-auto-5-endings-explained-ending-a-b-c/" target="_blank">[3]</a>.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Comparing the Endings: Themes and Impact</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Each ending offers a different perspective on loyalty and consequence:
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Ending A (Kill Trevor):</strong> Sacrifices chaos for stability but at the cost of friendship and loyalty.</li>
<li><strong>Ending B (Kill Michael):</strong> Prioritizes self-preservation but leaves Franklin isolated and morally compromised.</li>
<li><strong>Ending C (Deathwish):</strong> Defies the odds, allowing all three to survive. It’s the only ending where Franklin remains true to himself and his friends, but also means none of the trio are held accountable for their actions.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Rockstar’s narrative masterstroke is that there’s no undisputed “right” answer—each choice reveals something about Franklin’s values and the player’s outlook. Still, the “Deathwish” ending is widely regarded as canonical, as all three characters continue to appear in GTA Online updates <a href="https://eurogamer.net/gta-5-last-mission-kill-trevor-michael-or-deathwish-8026" target="_blank">[2]</a>.
