<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">How to Complete the First GTA 5 Mission: Prologue</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The <strong>Prologue</strong> is your introduction to the thrilling world of Grand Theft Auto V, setting the tone for the gameâ€™s epic story and action-packed gameplay. Whether youâ€™re a first-time player or returning to Los Santos, completing the Prologue smoothly will give you a strong start. This guide walks you through every step, providing helpful tips and insights for new and experienced players alike.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">What Is the Prologue in GTA 5?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The Prologue is the <strong>very first mission</strong> in GTA 5â€™s story mode, set in the snowy town of Ludendorff, North Yankton, back in 2004. Youâ€™ll play mainly as Michael Townley (later known as Michael De Santa) and Trevor Philips as they attempt a dramatic bank heist that sets the stage for the rest of the gameâ€™s narrative. This mission introduces you to core mechanics such as shooting, character switching, taking cover, and basic driving.<br/>
<em>Pro Tip:</em> Donâ€™t stress about perfectionâ€”this mission is designed to teach you the ropes and is quite forgiving compared to later heists. The choices you make here wonâ€™t affect the future storylines, so focus on learning the controls and enjoying the cinematic experience.<a href="#source5">[5]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Step-by-Step Walkthrough: Completing the Prologue</h2><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">1. The Bank Heist Begins</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The mission kicks off inside a bank with Michael, Trevor, and Brad. Follow the on-screen prompts to aim at the hostages and lead them into the storage room. Once everyone is secured, move to the vault and plant the explosives. Detonate them as instructed and collect the cash.
  </p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">2. Handling the Police Response</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    After grabbing the money, the alarm sounds and the police arrive. Here, youâ€™ll get your first taste of GTAâ€™s cover and shooting mechanics. Take cover behind objects, aim carefully, and eliminate the responding officers. The game will prompt you to switch between Michael and Trevor, especially when one character has a better angle or weapon. This is a great way to learn the <strong>character switching system</strong> that will be vital throughout the story.<a href="#source5">[5]</a>
</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">3. The Getaway</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Once outside, follow your crew to the getaway vehicle. The snowy streets limit visibility and handling, so drive cautiously to avoid obstacles or spinning out. If youâ€™re new to GTA, take your timeâ€”thereâ€™s little risk of failing at this stage.<br/>
    If police block the road, follow your crewmatesâ€™ lead and take the alternative route. After a dramatic chase, a cutscene will play, advancing the story and setting up future missions.
  </p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">4. Surviving the Final Standoff</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The mission ends with a standoff at a farmhouse. When prompted, use cover wisely and help fend off the final wave of police. After a series of cutscenes, youâ€™ll witness the fate of the crew and the prologue concludes. Congratulationsâ€”youâ€™ve completed your first GTA 5 mission!
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for a Smooth Prologue Playthrough</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Follow On-Screen Prompts:</strong> The game provides helpful instructions for new mechanics, so pay attention to these pop-ups.</li>
<li><strong>Use Cover:</strong> Donâ€™t rush into gunfights. Use the environment for cover, which will protect you from police gunfire.</li>
<li><strong>Practice Character Switching:</strong> When prompted, switch between Michael and Trevor to get comfortable with this featureâ€”it will be key for later missions.</li>
<li><strong>Drive Carefully:</strong> The snow and ice make driving trickier than usual. Brake early and steer gently to avoid crashing.</li>
<li><strong>Donâ€™t Worry About Gold Medals:</strong> The Prologue doesnâ€™t have Gold Medal objectives, so relax and focus on learning.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">What Happens After the Prologue?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    After the Prologue, youâ€™ll jump forward nine years to sunny Los Santos, where the main story truly begins. Youâ€™ll take control of Franklin and soon meet the other protagonists. Each mission builds on the skills you learned in the Prologue, so mastering these basics is essential for success throughout GTA 5.<a href="#source1">[1]</a>
