    Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) remains one of the most iconic open-world games, with a sprawling story mode that takes players through Los Santos‚Äô criminal underbelly. Whether you‚Äôre a newcomer or returning to the game for another playthrough, this mission-by-mission walkthrough will help you conquer every objective, maximize your earnings, and enjoy the narrative to its fullest.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Getting Started: Understanding GTA 5 Story Mode</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    GTA 5‚Äôs story mode follows three playable protagonists ‚Äî Michael, Franklin, and Trevor ‚Äî each with their own backgrounds, skills, and motivations. The main storyline features <strong>69 core missions</strong>, with additional optional side content and heists that can affect your overall progression and finances. 
  </p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The unique character-switching mechanic means strategies and mission approaches often vary depending on who you‚Äôre controlling. To achieve <strong>100% completion</strong>, you‚Äôll also need to tackle Strangers &amp; Freaks, Hobbies &amp; Pastimes, and collectibles scattered throughout Los Santos<span>[5]</span>.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Prologue and Early Missions</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The game opens with a tense prologue in North Yankton, introducing key mechanics and setting the stage for the intertwining stories. Early missions focus on Franklin‚Äôs life in Los Santos, Michael‚Äôs struggle with family and the past, and Trevor‚Äôs explosive entrance into the narrative. These initial missions teach you the basics of driving, combat, and character skills.
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Prologue</strong>: Learn the basics of cover, aiming, and character movement.</li>
<li><strong>Franklin and Lamar</strong>: Get introduced to Franklin‚Äôs world and car repossession.</li>
<li><strong>Repossession</strong> and <strong>Complications</strong>: Build driving and stealth skills.</li>
<li><strong>Father/Son</strong> and <strong>Friend Request</strong>: Start Michael‚Äôs arc and learn about hacking, quick-time events, and more.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Key Missions and Heists: Strategies for Success</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    GTA 5‚Äôs heists are story highlights, requiring preparation and offering multiple approaches. Your choices impact both the difficulty and your final payout, so consider your crew and tactics carefully.
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>The Jewel Store Job</strong>: Decide between a stealthy or aggressive approach. Select skilled crew members to maximize profit.</li>
<li><strong>Blitz Play</strong>: A high-octane heist involving all three protagonists ‚Äî coordinate their actions to succeed.</li>
<li><strong>The Merryweather Heist, Paleto Score, and Union Depository</strong>: Increasingly complex operations that test your planning and shooting abilities.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Each heist introduces setup missions, such as stealing vehicles or equipment. Completing optional objectives during these missions contributes toward <strong>Gold Medals</strong> and achievement progress<span>[1]</span>.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Character-Specific Missions</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Alongside the main story, each protagonist has unique missions that explore their personal lives and contribute to the larger plot. For example:
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Franklin</strong>: Missions like ‚ÄúChop‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Long Stretch‚Äù develop his relationships and ambitions.</li>
<li><strong>Michael</strong>: ‚ÄúMarriage Counseling‚Äù and ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs Little Girl‚Äù delve into family dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Trevor</strong>: ‚ÄúMr. Philips,‚Äù ‚ÄúNervous Ron,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrystal Maze‚Äù establish his presence in Blaine County.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Balancing these missions with the main storyline is essential for unlocking later heists and story events<span>[2]</span>.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Optional Missions: Assassinations and Strangers &amp; Freaks</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Lester‚Äôs <strong>Assassination Missions</strong> are best saved until after the main story, as your final cash reserves will be much higher if you invest in the stock market beforehand. Strangers &amp; Freaks missions, available across all three characters, offer unique encounters, challenges, and rewards that enrich the game's world.
  </p><ul>
<li>Complete all five Lester assassinations only after the main story to maximize profits<span>[1][5]</span>.</li>
<li>Seek out Strangers &amp; Freaks (marked ‚Äú?‚Äù on the map) for odd jobs, races, and collectibles.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Endgame: The Final Missions and Three Endings</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The story culminates in a dramatic series of missions leading up to the grand finale. Players ultimately choose one of three endings, each with its own consequences for the main characters. To experience every possible outcome, save your game before the final mission and explore each option.
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Deathwish</strong>: All three protagonists survive and confront their enemies together.</li>
<li><strong>Kill Michael</strong>: Franklin is forced to betray Michael.</li>
<li><strong>Kill Trevor</strong>: Franklin is forced to betray Trevor.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    For most players, the Deathwish ending is considered the most satisfying, as it preserves the trio‚Äôs alliance and allows for post-game free-roaming with all characters.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for 100% Completion</h2><ul>
<li>Complete all <strong>69 main story missions</strong> and 5 Lester assassinations<span>[5]</span>.</li>
<li>Finish at least 20 Strangers &amp; Freaks missions, 14 random events, and participate in various hobbies and pastimes.</li>
<li>Collectibles (spaceship parts, letter scraps, etc.) are required for 100% and can be tracked using interactive maps<span>[2]</span>.</li>
<li>Gold Medals are not required for 100%, but at least 70 are needed for the ‚ÄúSolid Gold, Baby!‚Äù trophy<span>[1]</span>.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Replayability and Mission Scoring</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Missions can be replayed at any time from the pause menu, letting you improve your scores, complete missed objectives, and earn Gold Medals. Each objective can be completed across multiple playthroughs, so perfectionists can focus on one target at a time<span>[1]</span>.
