<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">GTA 5 Ending Choices: Which Option is Best?</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Few games have captivated audiences and inspired as much discussion as <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>. Among its most memorable moments is the final decision players must make: <strong>which ending to choose</strong>. At the climax of the story, Franklin Clinton is faced with three mutually exclusive options â€“ kill Trevor, kill Michael, or team up with both in the so-called "Deathwish" ending. Each choice carries significant consequences for the game's characters, narrative, and the playerâ€™s future in Los Santos.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Three GTA 5 Endings Explained</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">After the high-stakes <em>Union Depository Bank heist</em>, Franklin returns home only to be approached by antagonists Steve Haines and Devin Weston. They demand he kill either Trevor or Michael, each for their own reasons: Trevorâ€™s unpredictability and Michaelâ€™s involvement in Devinâ€™s failed revenge. The game presents three possible endings:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Option A: Kill Trevor ("Something Sensible")</strong> â€“ Franklin hunts down Trevor, resulting in a violent and emotional end for one of GTA 5â€™s most iconic characters.</li>
<li><strong>Option B: Kill Michael ("The Time's Come")</strong> â€“ Franklin betrays Michael, culminating in a tense chase and a tragic farewell to his mentor.</li>
<li><strong>Option C: Deathwish ("The Third Way")</strong> â€“ Franklin refuses to pick sides, instead teaming up with Trevor and Michael to take down all their enemies â€“ Haines, Weston, and the rest â€“ in an epic showdown.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Players are free to select whichever ending they feel suits their vision of the story, but each choice has lasting effects on gameplay and character availability.<a href="#source2">[2]</a><a href="#source3">[3]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Consequences of Each Ending</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Choosing to kill Trevor or Michael means losing access to that character permanently. Their unique side missions, dialogue, and abilities â€“ as well as any ongoing story content â€“ are gone. The game world feels emptier, and the trioâ€™s dynamic vanishes. Additionally, post-ending phone calls and interactions reflect the fallout of your decision, often resulting in remorse or awkward silences.<a href="#source4">[4]</a><a href="#source5">[5]</a></p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">In contrast, the Deathwish ending keeps all three protagonists alive. This not only preserves their relationships and banter but also allows players to enjoy full access to side missions, properties, and gameplay features. The city remains vibrant, and the game offers more replay value and narrative satisfaction.<a href="#source1">[1]</a><a href="#source3">[3]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Which Ending Is Considered Best?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">While Rockstar Games gives players the freedom to choose, <strong>Deathwish</strong> is widely regarded as the <strong>best and most satisfying ending</strong> for most players:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Canon Status:</strong> Deathwish is confirmed as the canonical ending by Rockstar and in official guides, meaning itâ€™s the intended conclusion to the GTA V story.<a href="#source1">[1]</a><a href="#source3">[3]</a></li>
<li><strong>All Characters Survive:</strong> Keeping Michael, Trevor, and Franklin alive ensures the gameâ€™s full content remains accessible, maximizing enjoyment and replayability.</li>
<li><strong>Epic Finale:</strong> The Third Way delivers an exhilarating final battle against all major antagonists, providing closure and high stakes.</li>
<li><strong>Emotional Resolution:</strong> Unlike the other endings, Deathwish allows the protagonists to reconcile and continue their complex relationships, satisfying both narrative and character development.</li>
<li><strong>Player Freedom:</strong> With all three characters, players can freely switch between storylines, side activities, and unique gameplay styles post-story.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Ultimately, Deathwish offers the most content, the richest story resolution, and is the preferred choice for players who want the fullest GTA 5 experience.<a href="#source1">[1]</a><a href="#source3">[3]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Why Some Players Pick Other Endings</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Despite the advantages of Deathwish, some players choose to kill Trevor or Michael for role-playing, curiosity, or to experience all possible outcomes. These endings can offer unique emotional impacts and alternate story arcs, but they are generally considered less rewarding in terms of gameplay and narrative.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Post-Ending Gameplay and Replayability</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">After the ending, players can continue exploring Los Santos, completing side missions, investing in stocks, and causing mayhem. However, the absence of a character (if Trevor or Michael was killed) limits available missions and interactions. For completionists, Deathwish is the only way to achieve 100% completion easily and enjoy all of GTA 5â€™s features.<a href="#source1">[1]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Watch: All GTA 5 Endings Compared (PS5 Gameplay)</h2><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="blog-video" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/paVVJGAoHNY" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 100%;" width="560"></iframe><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">This recent video showcases all three endings in detail, including post-ending calls and conversations. Itâ€™s a great way to compare the emotional impact and see the consequences of each choice.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Sources</h2><ul>
