<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">GTA 5 Jewel Store Heist Walkthrough: Complete Guide for the First Heist</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">The Jewel Store Heist marks a pivotal moment early in <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>, introducing players to the thrill of planning and executing a high-stakes job. Whether youâ€™re chasing Gold medal objectives or just want to get the biggest payout, this step-by-step walkthrough will help you master every stage of the mission, from setup to getaway.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Heist Overview: The Jewel Store Job</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">The Jewel Store Heist is the first major heist mission in GTA 5â€™s story mode. Michael, desperate to pay off Martin Madrazo, teams up with Franklin and a hand-picked crew to rob Vangelico, a luxury jewelry store in Rockford Hills. Youâ€™ll choose between two approaches: 'Smart' (using knockout gas and stealth) or 'Loud' (going in guns blazing). This guide covers the <strong>Smart approach</strong>, the most popular and efficient method for new players.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Setup Missions</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Before you can pull off the heist, you need to complete a series of setup missions:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Casing the Jewel Store:</strong> Scope out the store and take photographs of key security features.</li>
<li><strong>Bugstars Equipment:</strong> Steal an exterminator van for your disguise.</li>
<li><strong>BZ Gas Grenades:</strong> Acquire knockout gas grenades to incapacitate the staff and customers during the heist.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Once these are complete, youâ€™ll be ready for the main event.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Choosing the Best Crew</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Your choice of <strong>hacker</strong>, <strong>driver</strong>, and <strong>gunman</strong> will impact both your time in the store and your take-home pay:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Hacker:</strong> The better the hacker (Paige Harris is best), the more time youâ€™ll have to loot cabinets (up to 90 seconds).</li>
<li><strong>Driver:</strong> A skilled driver (Eddie Toh) ensures a smoother escape and higher take, but you can save money with a less experienced choice if youâ€™re confident in your skills.</li>
<li><strong>Gunman:</strong> An inexperienced gunman (Norm Richards) can drop loot during the escape, costing you money. Choose a competent gunman to avoid this loss.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Executing the Heist (Smart Approach)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    1. <strong>Meet at Darnell Bros:</strong> Gather your crew for a final briefing with Lester.<br/>
    2. <strong>Drive to Vangelico:</strong> Michael and Franklin head to the store with the crew following in the van.<br/>
    3. <strong>Infiltration:</strong> Franklin climbs up to the rooftop and tosses the BZ gas grenade into the storeâ€™s ventilation system. Aim slightly low to avoid missing the vent.<br/>
    4. <strong>Robbery:</strong> Once the gas takes effect, Michael and crew enter the store. Smash the display cases quicklyâ€”there are 20 cabinets total. The Gold Medal objective requires looting all cabinets in under 50 secondsâ€”prioritize speed and efficiency.<br/>
    5. <strong>Escape:</strong> Franklin collects the bikes from the alley as the team grabs the loot. The crew escapes on bikes through the Los Santos storm drains. Stick with your crew, avoid police, and follow the route through tunnels and sewers to reach the getaway vehicle.<br/>
    6. <strong>Getaway:</strong> Once in the getaway truck, shake off any remaining police and drive to the drop-off point to complete the mission.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Gold Medal Requirements</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Quick Grab:</strong> Steal the jewelry in under 50 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Protege Protected:</strong> Make sure Franklin is safe during the LS River chase.</li>
<li><strong>Clean Sweep:</strong> Loot all 20 cabinets in the store.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Using a good hacker gives you more time for the Clean Sweep and Quick Grab objectives. Practice your smashing technique to maximize efficiency, and stay calm during the escape sequence for the best results.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for a Successful Heist</h2><ul>
<li>Pick Paige Harris as your hacker for extra time inside the store.</li>
<li>Use the mini-map to find all glass cabinets quickly during the robbery.</li>
<li>Stick to the planned escape route and avoid unnecessary detours; the police will be in hot pursuit.</li>
<li>Replay the mission from the pause menu if you want to improve your score or try different crew combinations.</li>
