    For crime movie fans, GTA 5 is a love letter to Michael Mann‚Äôs <strong>Heat</strong>. The game‚Äôs elaborate heists don‚Äôt just evoke the film‚Äôs tense shootouts and planning scenes‚Äîthey sometimes outright replicate them. Michael‚Äôs character design, complete with his wardrobe and demeanor, closely mirrors Robert DeNiro‚Äôs Neil McCauley. Many missions follow a similar arc to the movie, making Heat‚Äôs influence unmistakable.<br/>

    Car chases and elaborate getaways are a staple of GTA, and the game nods to classics like <strong>The Italian Job</strong> and the <strong>Fast &amp; Furious</strong> franchise.
