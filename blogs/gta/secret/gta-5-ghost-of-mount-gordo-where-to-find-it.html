    Few mysteries in <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> are as famous‚Äîor as eerie‚Äîas the <strong>Ghost of Mount Gordo</strong>. This chilling apparition, tied to the tragic backstory of Jolene Cranley-Evans, has become one of the game‚Äôs most iconic Easter eggs. If you‚Äôre hoping to experience this ghostly encounter for yourself, here‚Äôs everything you need to know about where to find her, what to expect, and why this secret continues to captivate players years after release.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Story Behind the Ghost: Jolene Cranley-Evans</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The ghost haunting Mount Gordo isn‚Äôt just a random spook‚Äîshe‚Äôs Jolene Cranley-Evans, the wife of Jock Cranley, a famous stuntman in the GTA universe. According to in-game lore, <strong>Jolene‚Äôs tragic fate</strong> was sealed when her husband pushed her off a cliff at Mount Gordo after a heated dispute. Jolene wanted to stay in Blaine County to care for her family‚Äôs guest home, while Jock dreamed of pursuing his stunt career elsewhere. This argument ended in murder, and Jolene‚Äôs restless spirit now lingers where her life ended[3][4].

    To experience this spectral sighting, timing and location are everything. <strong>The ghost only appears at a specific spot and time each night</strong> in the game.
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Near the peak of Mount Gordo, on the eastern side of the map in Blaine County. Look for a large, flat rock with the word ‚ÄúJOCK‚Äù written in what appears to be blood‚Äîthis is the key marker.</li>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> The ghost manifests from <strong>23:00 to 00:00 (11 PM to midnight)</strong> in-game time. That‚Äôs just four minutes of real-time, so plan your trip accordingly[3][4][1].</li>
<li><strong>How to Get There:</strong> The easiest way is to approach from the north, using the dirt paths leading up Mount Gordo. Mark your map near the ‚ÄúJOCK‚Äù blood message for precision.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Arrive at the location during the right time window, and you‚Äôll see a <strong>female ghost in a white dress</strong> with long black hair, floating above the rock. She appears slightly translucent, with a petrified expression and white, empty eyes. If you try to get too close, she‚Äôll vanish, so keep your distance for the best view[3][4][1].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Seeing the Ghost</h2><ul>
<li>
<strong>Use a Sniper Rifle or Camera:</strong> The ghost fades if you approach on foot, but you can still see her clearly through a sniper scope or your phone‚Äôs camera zoom[3][2].
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Don‚Äôt Expect Rewards:</strong> There‚Äôs no in-game monetary or XP reward for finding the ghost‚Äîthis is purely an atmospheric Easter egg[4].
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Listen for Cues:</strong> As you approach, you might hear whispers or eerie screams‚Äîa nice touch that amps up the suspense[1].
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Go Anytime:</strong> This ghost is available year-round, not just during Halloween events[4].
    </li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Why Is the Ghost of Mount Gordo So Popular?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
