Earning big money in GTA 5 doesn't end with heists and stock market tricksâ€”there are <strong>12 hidden packages</strong> scattered around Los Santos and Blaine County just waiting for clever players to claim them. These briefcases, often found underwater, offer thousands of free dollars and can be a real game changer, especially in the endgame when cash gets tight. In this guide, you'll find the exact locations of all hidden packages, strategies for collecting them safely, and pro tips to maximize your loot.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">What Are Hidden Packages in GTA 5?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
Hidden packages are collectible briefcases filled with cash, usually located <strong>underwater near wrecked planes, ships, or vehicles</strong>. They're designed as a little bonus for players who love exploration and want to boost their in-game wealth. Most of the packages contain between <strong>$7,000 and $25,000</strong> each, making the total haul significant if you track them all down.<br/>
Keep in mind: <strong>11 out of 12 hidden packages are underwater</strong>, so make sure you have access to scuba gear, a Dinghy, or a submersible like the Minisub for the deepest dives.[1]
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Essential Gear for Your Underwater Search</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
To safely and efficiently collect every hidden package, make sure you have:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Scuba suit or diving gear:</strong> Available after completing certain missions or by using a submersible.</li>
<li><strong>Dinghy or Minisub:</strong> Both can transport you directly to deep-water locations and come equipped with diving equipment.[2]</li>
<li><strong>Sniper rifle or binoculars (optional):</strong> Helps you spot wrecks from the surface before you dive.</li>

</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Pro Tips for Collecting Hidden Packages</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quick Save and Reload:</strong> On some platforms, hidden packages only appear after you quick-save and reload your game at the location. Try this if the briefcase isnâ€™t spawning.[2][4]</li>
<li><strong>Respawn Exploit:</strong> After picking up a package, quickly switch to another character and then back. The package may respawn, letting you collect it repeatedly. This is time-consuming but a great way to farm cash.[5]</li>
<li><strong>Watch Out for Sharks:</strong> Some locations are in shark territory. Move quickly and keep an eye on your radar!</li>
<li><strong>Use the Interactive Map:</strong> For exact GPS points, check IGNâ€™s GTA 5 interactive map for hidden package locations.[2]</li>
