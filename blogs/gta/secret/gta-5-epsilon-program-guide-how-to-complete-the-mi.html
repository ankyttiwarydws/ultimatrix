<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">GTA 5 Epsilon Program Guide: How to Complete the Missions</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">The Epsilon Program is one of Grand Theft Auto V‚Äôs most mysterious and entertaining side missions. As Michael De Santa, you‚Äôll dive deep into the satirical world of cults, chasing ‚Äúenlightenment‚Äù through a series of bizarre quests. This guide will walk you through every step required to complete the Epsilon Program, maximize your rewards, and unravel one of Los Santos' strangest stories.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">What is the Epsilon Program?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">The Epsilon Program is a fictional cult in GTA 5, parodying real-life organizations with promises of spiritual awakening and financial ‚Äúdonations.‚Äù The storyline is entirely optional and only available to Michael. Completing the full questline can net you up to $2,100,000, though it also offers some unique experiences and unlockables along the way.<br/>
  The missions are not required for 100% game completion, but they‚Äôre among the most memorable and quirky activities you‚Äôll find in Los Santos.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How to Start the Epsilon Program Missions</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    To begin, access Michael and browse the in-game internet. Visit the Epsilon website (search for "Epsilon Program") and complete the "Evaluate Your Identity" survey. Shortly after, you‚Äôll receive a contact from Marnie, who will initiate the first mission. Be prepared for some hefty in-game donations and a series of odd tasks!
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Step-by-Step Epsilon Program Mission Guide</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Here‚Äôs a breakdown of each mission and tips for completion:</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">1. Seeking the Truth</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    After the online survey, you‚Äôll meet Marnie in person. She‚Äôll ask for a $500 donation, which you‚Äôll pay via the Epsilon website. Wait for her call to trigger the next quest.<br/>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Sleep or save the game to fast-forward time if the next mission doesn‚Äôt appear right away.
  </p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">2. Accepting the Truth</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    You‚Äôll need to make a second, larger donation of $5,000. Once paid, another location will appear on your map. Head there to meet Jimmy Boston, a prominent Epsilon member, and continue your journey.
  </p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">3. Assuming the Truth</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    For this mission, you must collect five specific vehicles for the cult:<br/>
    - <b>Declasse Tornado</b><br/>
    - <b>Pegassi Vacca</b><br/>
    - <b>Benefactor Surano</b><br/>
    - <b>Enus Super Diamond</b><br/>
    - <b>Cheval Surge</b><br/>
    Park each vehicle at the Epsilon marker in Vinewood Hills. You can find these cars driving around Los Santos or parked in various locations.<br/>
<strong>Tip:</strong> Use the internet to locate spawn points if you‚Äôre having trouble finding a model.
  </p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">4. Chasing the Truth</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Michael is sent on a scavenger hunt for three ‚Äúextraterrestrial‚Äù items:<br/>
    - <b>TV</b>: Located northwest from the mission starting point, along a fence.<br/>
    - <b>Battery</b>: North of the TV, near some bushes before the terrain drops off to a river.<br/>
    - <b>Boot</b>: Southeast from the battery, just past a picnic area.<br/>
    After collecting all items, donate another $10,000 on the Epsilon website (two payments of $5,000) to unlock the next mission.
  </p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">5. Bearing the Truth</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Now, you must purchase Epsilon robes for $25,000 from the cult‚Äôs website. Once delivered (after a game-day), wear them for ten consecutive days. The fastest way to pass time is to repeatedly sleep at Michael‚Äôs safehouse.<br/>
<strong>Tip:</strong> You can still do other activities, but make sure to keep the robes on for the full duration.
  </p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">6. Delivering the Truth</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Michael is tasked with delivering a blue Velum plane to a remote airstrip in Sandy Shores. Fly cautiously, avoiding police attention, and land the plane safely to progress.
  </p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">7. Exercising the Truth</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    In this mission, you‚Äôll have to run five miles through the Grand Senora Desert while still wearing the Epsilon robes. Keep an eye on Michael‚Äôs stamina and health‚Äîuse snacks or take breaks if needed. The mission will track your distance, so just keep jogging until you hit the mark.
  </p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">8. Unknowing the Truth</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The final mission gives you a choice: deliver a car full of cash to the Epsilon Program and receive a modest reward, or betray the cult and steal the $2.1 million for yourself. If you choose betrayal, escape the pursuing cultists to keep the money. Alternatively, deliver the car and receive an old tractor as a reward.<br/>
<strong>Tip:</strong> For most players, keeping the cash is the best option!
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Rewards and Unlockables</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Depending on your choices, completing the Epsilon Program can grant you:<br/>
    - Up to <b>$2,100,000</b> in cash<br/>
    - An old tractor (if you side with the cult)<br/>
    - The unique Epsilon robes for Michael<br/>
    - The ‚ÄúKifflom!‚Äù achievement/trophy<br/>
<br/>
    The missions are a fun and lucrative way to explore Los Santos while experiencing some of GTA 5‚Äôs sharpest satire.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Completing the Epsilon Missions Efficiently</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    - Always save before starting each mission in case something goes wrong.
    - Use sleep to quickly pass in-game time and advance to the next mission.
    - Make sure you have enough money before starting, as the required donations add up.
    - For the vehicle collection, use a guide or map for spawn locations.
    - During the final mission, use cover and powerful weapons if you decide to steal the money.
