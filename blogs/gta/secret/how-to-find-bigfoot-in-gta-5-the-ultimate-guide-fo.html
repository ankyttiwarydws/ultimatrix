<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">How to Find Bigfoot in GTA 5: The Ultimate Guide for 2025</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Grand Theft Auto V is famous for its secrets and urban legends, but few are as legendary as the hunt for Bigfoot. Whether you call him Sasquatch or Yeti, tracking down this elusive creature has become one of the game's most talked-about Easter eggs. In this guide, weâ€™ll break down exactly how you can find, encounter, and even play as Bigfoot in GTA 5 and GTA Online.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Why the Bigfoot Myth Matters in GTA 5</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Since its release, players have scoured the forests and mountains of Los Santos looking for any signs of Bigfoot. Rockstar Games has leaned into this legend, hiding multiple references, Easter eggs, and even allowing players to become the creature under certain conditions. The search for Bigfoot isnâ€™t just about seeing a mythical beastâ€”itâ€™s about uncovering one of GTA 5â€™s most satisfying secrets.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Classic Sasquatch Easter Egg</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">The original rumors of Bigfoot in GTA date back to San Andreas, but GTA 5 takes things further. In Story Mode, you can encounter the Sasquatch through a special mission and a secret peyote plant. Hereâ€™s what you need to know:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Mission: The Last One</strong> â€“ After 100% game completion, Franklin gets a mission where he tracks a supposed Bigfoot. The twist: itâ€™s a man in a suit. However, this is just the start of the myth.</li>
<li><strong>The Golden Peyote Plant</strong> â€“ A real transformation requires finding the golden peyote plant, which lets you play as Bigfoot. This plant is only available under very specific conditions, making it one of GTA 5â€™s rarest Easter eggs.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How to Find the Golden Peyote Plant and Become Bigfoot</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">To actually <strong>transform into Bigfoot</strong> in GTA 5, you need to find the golden peyote plant. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step rundown:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> The golden peyote is found on Mount Chiliad, near the summit, close to a lookout platform in Raton Canyon. It can also appear on a ridge near Grapeseed, depending on the day of the week.<br/>
<em>Tip: IGNâ€™s guide has detailed map locations to help you pinpoint the right spot.</em></li>
<li><strong>Time and Weather Requirements:</strong> You must search on a specific weekday (usually Tuesday or Saturday), between 5:30 AM and 8:00 AM in-game, and the weather must be foggy. If the conditions arenâ€™t right, the plant wonâ€™t appear.</li>
<li><strong>How to Trigger:</strong> Save your game near the location and reload until you get foggy weather in the right time window. Once you find the plant, interact with it, and your character will transform into Sasquatch!</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">This transformation lasts until you die or the effect wears off. While in Bigfoot form, you have unique attacks and can even use Director Mode to play as the creature after unlocking it.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Bigfoot in GTA Online: Yeti Clues and Peyote Plants</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Rockstar has kept the Bigfoot hype alive in GTA Online, especially during special events and updates. Hereâ€™s how you can get in on the action:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Special Peyote Plants:</strong> During certain events (like Halloween or winter updates), GTA Online adds peyote plants that let you transform into different animalsâ€”including Sasquatch. These are usually spread across the map, with locations shared by the community each time an event goes live.</li>
<li><strong>Yeti/White Bigfoot Outfit:</strong> In some updates, you can collect clues (like tents or broken cars) to unlock a white yeti outfit, giving your character the look of the mythic beast. This is purely cosmetic but makes for great screenshots and roleplay.</li>
<li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Some transformations require specific weather conditions (foggy, between 3:30 and 8:30 AM in-game) and are time-limited, so act fast when the event is active.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">For the most up-to-date locations, check community guides and recent videos, as Rockstar often shuffles these secrets with new updates.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips and Tricks for Bigfoot Hunters</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Save and Reload:</strong> To get the perfect weather, save near the location and reload until itâ€™s foggy in the right time window.</li>
<li><strong>Use Fast Vehicles:</strong> In GTA Online, reaching remote locations quickly is easiest with a helicopter or an Oppressor Mk II.</li>
<li><strong>Check for Events:</strong> Peyote plants and Bigfoot-related content are often tied to limited-time events, so keep an eye on Rockstarâ€™s newswire and community forums.</li>
<li><strong>Try Director Mode:</strong> Once unlocked, you can select Bigfoot in Director Mode for photos, videos, and fun gameplay experiments.</li>
