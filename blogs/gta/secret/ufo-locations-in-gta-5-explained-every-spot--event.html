    If you've ever gazed up at the night sky in <strong>GTA 5</strong> or <strong>GTA Online</strong> and caught a glimpse of something strange and glowing, you're not alone. Rockstar Games has packed the game with hidden UFOs, secret abductions, and event-exclusive rewards, especially during the annual Halloween event. In this blog, we'll break down every known UFO location in GTA 5, explain how and when to find them, and reveal the secrets of alien encounters and special items you can unlock.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How the UFO Event Works in GTA Online (2024 Update)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The biggest surge of UFO sightings in GTA Online happens during the Halloween event, which typically runs from mid-October through early November. <strong>Each night, a UFO spawns at a predetermined location</strong> across the map between <strong>10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. in-game time</strong>. The event lasts for 26 days, with a new UFO appearing every dayâ€”and on some days, multiple UFOs can be found hovering above San Andreas.<br/><br/>
    To participate, you need to:
    </p><ul>
<li>Log in during the event window (October 31 to November 3 sees the most dramatic changes, including alien skies).</li>
<li>Wait until 10:00 p.m. in-game time, then head to the day's UFO location.</li>
<li>Use your characterâ€™s Snapmatic camera to take a photo of the UFO and send it to Omega (an in-game contact).</li>
<li>Avoid getting too closeâ€”if you fly or drive near a UFO, it will emit an EMP pulse, disabling your vehicle and vanishing.</li>
<li>Stay in your lobby for at least five minutes before the UFO appears, as thereâ€™s a cooldown for new sessions.</li>
</ul><strong>Photographing every UFO unlocks exclusive rewards</strong><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">All UFO Locations in GTA 5 (2024 Halloween Event)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Hereâ€™s a breakdown of key UFO locations for the 2024 event. The UFOs rotate daily, but the following are some of the most notable spots:
    </p><ul>
<li><strong>Paleto Bay:</strong> Often the starting location for the first day.</li>
<li><strong>Mount Chiliad:</strong> A classic spot, with the UFO hovering near the mountainâ€™s peak.</li>
<li><strong>Vinewood Sign:</strong> Look above the iconic sign in Vinewood Hills.</li>
<li><strong>Galileo Observatory:</strong> A UFO often appears above this landmark.</li>
<li><strong>Vespucci Beach:</strong> Find a UFO hovering above the ocean or sand.</li>
<li><strong>Ron Alternates Wind Farm:</strong> Look out for a UFO above the turbines.</li>
<li><strong>Alamo Sea:</strong> Sometimes a UFO will appear over the water here.</li>
<li><strong>Server Farms and FIB Building:</strong> Tech and government locations are popular UFO haunts.</li>
</ul><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-online-ufos-locations-where-map/" target="_blank">full interactive map</a><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">What Happens If You Get Too Close?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    UFOs in GTA Online come with some defense mechanisms. If you approach one, itâ€™ll send out a powerful EMP blast, disabling your vehicleâ€”especially if youâ€™re in the air. Sometimes the UFO will vanish entirely if you get too close. The safest approach is to park at a distance, zoom in with your camera, and snap the photo from afar[3][5].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Alien Abduction and How to Escape</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    During the final days of the Halloween event, players have a <strong>chance of being abducted by a UFO</strong>. If this happens, you'll be teleported to a mysterious underground base, where you'll need to:
    </p><ul>
<li>Search for a crowbar (usually in the first room or the first room on the left).</li>
<li>Use the crowbar to open a crate and receive "The Shocker" melee weapon.</li>
<li>Escape the base by solving a lever puzzle based on symbols and objects in each room (e.g., waveform, DNA helix, four circles, particles spreading).</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips to Maximize Your UFO Hunt</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
</p><ul>
<li>Use a flying vehicle like the Oppressor Mk II, but be ready to bail quickly if the UFOâ€™s EMP goes off.</li>
<li>Set reminders for daily event windows to avoid missing unique spawns.</li>
<li>Snap your photo quickly and from a distance for the best results.</li>
<li>Check in during the last days of the event for the best chance at abductions and rare weather effects.</li>
