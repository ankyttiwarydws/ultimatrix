<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">Weirdest Things You Can Do in GTA Online (2025 Edition)</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">GTA Online has always been a chaotic playground where just about anything goes, but as the game has grownâ€”and as the player base has gotten more creativeâ€”the list of truly weird things you can do has exploded. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned Los Santos veteran or a curious newcomer, hereâ€™s a look at the strangest, most unexpected activities you can try in GTA Online right now.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">1. Become Invincible (Sort Of) With Passive Mode Glitches</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Passive mode is supposed to protect players from harm, but in 2025, inventive players have discovered a glitch that lets you use guns while in passive mode. You canâ€™t kill anyone, but you can destroy vehicles, troll others, and generally cause chaosâ€”without fear of retaliation. Annoying? Absolutely. Hilarious? You bet.<br/>
According to recent reports, this exploit isnâ€™t game-breaking, but itâ€™s certainly baffling to see someone in passive mode blowing up cars while you canâ€™t do a thing about it. Be warned, though: itâ€™s as weird as it is irritating, and Rockstar may patch it at any time.<a href="#source1">[1]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">2. Spawn Props and Trap Players in Free Mode</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">One of the wildest glitches lets players spawn huge propsâ€”ramps, tunnels, boxes, and moreâ€”anywhere in the open world. Some have taken to flying around, boxing in other players, or just creating absolute mayhem in unexpected places. Imagine cruising through Los Santos and suddenly finding yourself in a homemade maze or getting dropped into a box with no escape. Thereâ€™s no official way to stop these pranksters, so your only real defense is a sense of humor.<a href="#source1">[1]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">3. Experience the Game With a Glitched Camera Angle</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Ever wanted to see GTA Online from a totally bizarre perspective? Thereâ€™s a glitch involving the in-game shoe store, a wanted level, and the use of a nano drone that lets you respawn with a totally broken camera angle. The graphics can end up looking like a throwback to GTA San Andreas, and you can use the mini-map to navigate while your screen is a surreal mess. Itâ€™s disorienting, funny, and a favorite among players who love to break the gameâ€™s visuals.<a href="#source3">[3]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">4. Merge Outfits for Truly Absurd Fashion</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Clothing glitches are a staple of GTA Online, but in 2025, theyâ€™ve reached a whole new level. Players have found ways to mix and match items that arenâ€™t meant to go together, like merging hats with masks and even combining glasses, necklaces, and shirts for looks that defy logic (and Rockstarâ€™s intentions). Some of these combos require precise timing at vending machines or in the outfit menu, but the results are pure fashion chaos.<a href="#source5">[5]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">5. Become a Living Statue Inside Car Interiors</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Thereâ€™s a simple glitch that lets you stand inside the interior of any car, turning your character into a stationary statue while the car remains fully interactive for others. Itâ€™s great for confusing friends or just making yourself part of the scenery. All you need to do is visit a specific spot on the map and follow a few quick steps involving the character selection menu.<a href="#source2">[2]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">6. Turn the World Into a Low-Res Wonderland</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Some glitches can force the entire game into a low-res, blocky state that looks straight out of the early 2000s. By carefully timing actions during a police chase and then using certain in-game menus, you can reduce the world to a weird, unfinished version of itself. Itâ€™s the ultimate nostalgia tripâ€”or just a hilarious way to mess with your own eyes.<a href="#source3">[3]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">7. Launch Yourself Into Space (With a BMX Bike!)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Physics are more of a suggestion than a rule in GTA Online, and nowhere is that more obvious than with the BMX space-launch glitch. Players have figured out how to use ramps, speed boosts, and a few well-timed jumps to fling their bikes (and themselves) high above the map, sometimes out of bounds entirely. Itâ€™s absurd, exhilarating, and a perfect symbol of GTAâ€™s anything-goes attitude.<a href="#source4">[4]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">8. Rig the Casino (Sort Of)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">While you canâ€™t actually break the bank, there are glitches that let you manipulate certain casino games or cause odd effects, like making the wheel spin endlessly or displaying bizarre graphics. These tricks rarely net you real profits, but theyâ€™re a fun way to confuse other gamblersâ€”and yourself.<a href="#source4">[4]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Watch: The Weirdest Glitches in GTA Online (2025)</h2><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="blog-video" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ejXCSLIoIVA" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 100%;" width="560"></iframe><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Final Thoughts</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">GTA Online may have its share of issues in 2025, but itâ€™s also a playground for the weird, the wonderful, and the outright absurd. These glitches and exploits change all the time, so if you want to experience them, hop in soonâ€”before Rockstar patches them out (or makes them even weirder).</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Sources</h2><ul>
