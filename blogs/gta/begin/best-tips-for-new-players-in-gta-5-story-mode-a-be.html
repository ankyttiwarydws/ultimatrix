<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">Best Tips for New Players in GTA 5 Story Mode</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Grand Theft Auto V, often abbreviated as GTA 5, is an open-world masterpiece that blends action, storytelling, and freedom like few games can. Whether youâ€™re picking up the controller for the first time or returning after a long break, Story Mode offers a vast playground full of opportunities, challenges, and secrets. To help you thrive in Los Santos, here are the best tips every new player should know.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">1. Master the Basics: Controls and Settings Matter</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Before diving into missions, take a moment to adjust your <strong>controls and camera settings</strong>. GTA 5 offers customizable options for camera height and aiming that can dramatically improve your gameplay comfort. Experiment with these settings so youâ€™re ready for both high-speed chases and intense shootouts.<br/>
    Use the <strong>Snapmatic app</strong> on your characterâ€™s phone for fun selfies and snapshotsâ€”itâ€™s a small feature, but it helps you get familiar with the phoneâ€™s interface, which youâ€™ll use throughout the game.<a href="#source1">[1]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">2. Focus on Main Missions and Heists Early</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Story missions and heists are the heart of GTA 5. Completing these not only advances the plot but also unlocks new areas, vehicles, and features. <strong>Heists</strong>, in particular, offer massive cash rewards and let you assemble a crewâ€”choosing the right members can mean more money in your pocket, so plan carefully.<a href="#source3">[3]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">3. Maximize Your Money: Investments, Side Hustles, and Loot</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Money isnâ€™t just for show in Los Santos. Itâ€™s essential for buying properties, vehicles, weapons, and upgrades. Here are several ways to boost your bank balance:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Heists:</strong> Plan them well for the biggest payouts. Research crew members to maximize profit without risking mission failure.<a href="#source2">[2]</a></li>
<li><strong>Random Encounters:</strong> Keep an eye out for blue and white dots on the map. These short missions can offer extra cash and unique rewards.<a href="#source3">[3]</a></li>
<li><strong>Stock Market:</strong> Pay attention to Lester's assassination missions. Invest in relevant stocks before and after each job to multiply your earnings dramatically.</li>
<li><strong>Hidden Loot:</strong> Some powerful weapons and cash pickups are scattered across the map. For example, the <strong>assault shotgun</strong> can be found in the Altruist camp, and the <strong>minigun</strong> is hidden in Fort Zancudo.<a href="#source2">[2]</a></li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">4. Use the Three-Character System Strategically</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Switching between Michael, Franklin, and Trevor isnâ€™t just a narrative gimmickâ€”itâ€™s a tactical advantage. Each character has a unique skill set:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Franklin:</strong> Best driver, with a special ability to slow time in vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Michael:</strong> Marksman, can slow time during gunfights.</li>
<li><strong>Trevor:</strong> Deals extra damage and takes less damage in combat.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Switch to the best-suited character for missions or activities. Use Franklin for races, Michael for shootouts, and Trevor when you need to cause chaos.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">5. Upgrade Wisely: Weapons, Cars, and Properties</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Donâ€™t blow your early cash on flashy cars or unnecessary weapons. Instead, focus on:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Essential weapons:</strong> All you really need early on is a reliable shotgun, a carbine rifle, a sniper rifle, and a heavy weapon (like an RPG or grenade launcher). Many of these can be found for free if you explore.<a href="#source2">[2]</a></li>
<li><strong>Basic vehicle upgrades:</strong> Spend money on armor and bulletproof tires for your favorite getaway car.</li>
<li><strong>Income-generating properties:</strong> Purchase businesses that offer weekly payouts. Some properties also unlock new side missions.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">6. Learn the Police and Wanted System</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Understanding how the <strong>wanted system</strong> works can save your life (and your cash). In rural areas, police response is slower, so you can get away with more. If youâ€™re being chased, use alleys, sewers, and train tracks to break the line of sight and lose your wanted level faster.<a href="#source1">[1]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">7. Save Frequently and Use Multiple Slots</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">GTA 5â€™s auto-save is reliable, but using manual saves and multiple slots can help you avoid losing progress or getting stuck in a tough spot. Before big missions or heists, always save manually.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">8. Explore and Have Fun!</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Donâ€™t rush through the story. Los Santos is packed with secrets, collectibles, Easter eggs, and hilarious random events. Take time to explore, try different side activities (like golf, tennis, or skydiving), and enjoy the world Rockstar has built.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Watch: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to GTA 5 Story Mode</h2><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="blog-video" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44_QsFkx8_4" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 100%;" width="560"></iframe><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Check out this up-to-date beginnerâ€™s guide for a visual walkthrough and more insider tips on thriving in GTA 5 Story Mode.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading" id="Sources">Sources</h2><ul>
