Whether you're new to GTA 5 or returning for another adventure, understanding how to progress through "Welcome to Los Santos" will set the stage for the game's sprawling story and open-world chaos.

    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Introducing GTA 5 and the First Mission</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        GTA 5 begins with intensity. The prologue sets the tone, but the real story kicks off with <strong>Welcome to Los Santos</strong>. This mission marks your introduction to Franklin Clinton, one of the game's three main protagonists. You'll learn the basics of driving, navigation, and the criminal underworld that defines Los Santos. The mission is also tied to a secret achievement or trophy, so it's unmissable for story progression and completionists alike.<a href="#source3">[3]</a>
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Prologue Recap: Setting the Stage</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        Before you hit the streets of Los Santos, GTA 5 opens with a flashback heist in North Yankton. You'll control Michael Townley and Trevor Philips as they rob a bank. This action-packed sequence introduces you to the game's cover system, basic gunplay, and character-switching mechanic. Once the prologue concludes, the story fast-forwards to the sun-soaked city of Los Santos, where the main game begins.
    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Welcome to Los Santos: Mission Objectives</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        As the title card fades in, you meet Franklin Clinton and his friend Lamar Davis, working as repo men for a luxury car dealership. Their boss, Simeon Yetarian, sends them out to repossess two high-end vehicles. Your objective is to help Franklin steal a white sports car, teaching you the fundamentals of driving and pursuit.
    </p><ul>
<li><strong>Drive to the House:</strong> Follow Lamar to the marked location on the map. This is your first chance to get a feel for Los Santos' sprawling neighborhoods and the game's responsive driving controls.</li>
<li><strong>Steal the Car:</strong> Once you arrive, sneak onto the property, find the car, and drive it away. The game introduces stealth mechanics and basic climbing here.</li>
<li><strong>Race Back to the Dealership:</strong> A friendly (but intense) race with Lamar back to Simeon's dealership gives you a sense of the game's speed, handling, and the importance of avoiding police attention.</li>
<li><strong>Return the Car:</strong> After the race, park the car at the dealership. This completes your first mission and unlocks new storylines and activities.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Completing 'Welcome to Los Santos'</h2><ul>
