<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">GTA 5 Weapons Guide: Best Guns for Beginners (2025)</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Jumping into <strong>GTA 5 Online</strong> for the first time can feel overwhelming, especially when it comes to choosing the right weapon. With dozens of guns available and limited starting cash, picking the best beginner weapons can be the difference between surviving missions and endless respawns. This guide breaks down the most effective, affordable, and easy-to-use guns for new players in GTA 5 Online as of 2025.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Why Picking the Right Weapon Matters</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">In GTA 5 Online, success in missions, heists, and player-versus-player (PvP) encounters often depends on your arsenal. The right weapon not only boosts your chances of survival but also helps you earn more money by completing objectives efficiently. Beginners should focus on <strong>versatile, reliable, and cost-effective guns</strong> that are easy to use and unlock early in the game.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Top Weapon Categories for Beginners</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Weapons in GTA 5 fall into several categories. As a new player, youâ€™ll want at least one solid option from each of the following:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Assault Rifles</strong> â€“ Great for most combat situations</li>
<li><strong>SMGs (Submachine Guns)</strong> â€“ Perfect for drive-bys and close quarters</li>
<li><strong>Shotguns</strong> â€“ Devastating at close range, especially indoors</li>
<li><strong>Pistols</strong> â€“ Your default backup weapon</li>
<li><strong>Heavy/Special Weapons</strong> â€“ For vehicles or tough enemies</li>
<li><strong>Marksman/Sniper Rifles</strong> â€“ For the occasional long-range need</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Best Beginner Weapons in GTA 5 Online</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Letâ€™s break down the most recommended guns for new players, focusing on those you can unlock early and get the most value from.</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">1. Special Carbine (Assault Rifle)</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">The <strong>Special Carbine</strong> is widely considered the best starter assault rifle in GTA 5 Online. It unlocks early, is affordable, and offers an excellent balance of fire rate, accuracy, and damage. Youâ€™ll find it extremely reliable for both missions and PvP. The Special Carbine is great for headshots and versatile in most scenarios, making it an ideal all-purpose weapon for new players<a href="#source1">[1]</a>.</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">2. AP Pistol (SMG Class)</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">The <strong>AP Pistol</strong> is a fan favorite for beginners because itâ€™s fully automatic, can be used while driving, and boasts a high fire rate. With an extended magazine, it holds up to 36 rounds, making it perfect for chasing down enemies or defending yourself on the road. Its controllability and fast reload make it a must-have early on<a href="#source5">[5]</a>.</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">3. Assault Shotgun (Shotgun Class)</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">If youâ€™re looking for a powerful close-range option, the <strong>Assault Shotgun</strong> is your best bet. It offers the highest fire rate and largest ammo capacity among shotguns, making it extremely effective for indoor missions or tight spaces. While it unlocks at Rank 37, itâ€™s worth saving up for, as it can clear rooms in seconds<a href="#source1">[1]</a>.</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">4. Heavy Shotgun (Shotgun Class â€“ Early Option)</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">For those who want a solid shotgun option even earlier, the <strong>Heavy Shotgun</strong> is a semi-automatic weapon with great range and stopping power. Itâ€™s customizable and can one-shot most enemies at close range, making it very effective for beginners tackling missions and heists<a href="#source3">[3]</a>.</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">5. Combat MG (Machine Gun Class)</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">The <strong>Combat MG</strong> might take a bit longer to unlock, but itâ€™s worth mentioning for its high fire rate and damage. Itâ€™s especially useful against tougher enemies and works well as a companion to your primary assault rifle. This gun is perfect for missions with waves of enemies or for holding down objectives<a href="#source1">[1]</a>.</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">6. Homing Launcher (Heavy/Special Weapon)</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">While most heavy weapons are locked for beginners, the <strong>Homing Launcher</strong> is a great early investment. It lets you easily take down enemy helicopters and vehicles by locking on and firing. This is especially helpful in missions where air support or armored cars show up<a href="#source2">[2]</a>.</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">7. Marksman Rifle (Long-Range Option)</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Sniper rifles are often locked behind higher ranks, but the <strong>Marksman Rifle</strong> is a solid alternative for beginners needing long-range firepower. Itâ€™s accurate, fires quickly, and can one-shot headshot most enemies. While not essential early on, itâ€™s a good choice if you find yourself needing to pick off targets from a distance<a href="#source2">[2]</a>.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Picking and Upgrading Your First Guns</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Prioritize versatility</strong>: Choose weapons that perform well in most situations instead of ultra-specialized guns.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade when you can</strong>: Spend money on extended magazines, suppressors, and grips to improve your weaponâ€™s performance.</li>
<li><strong>Donâ€™t overspend early</strong>: Stick to reliable weapons until youâ€™ve built up enough cash for better gear.</li>
<li><strong>Test guns in the shooting range</strong>: Try before you buy to see which weapons fit your play style.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on accuracy over spray</strong>: Headshots save ammo and take down enemies faster, especially with the Special Carbine or Marksman Rifle.</li>
