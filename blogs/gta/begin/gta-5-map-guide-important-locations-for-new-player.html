Jumping into Grand Theft Auto V for the first time can feel overwhelming. The map is massive, packed with urban sprawl, scenic wilderness, and secret spots waiting to be discovered. Whether you want to progress through the story, hunt for collectibles, or simply explore, knowing the lay of the land is essential. This guide breaks down the most important locations every new player should know about, with tips to help you get started in Los Santos and Blaine County.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Understanding the GTA 5 Map</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
The heart of GTA 5 is the fictional city of <strong>Los Santos</strong>, inspired by Los Angeles, surrounded by the rural expanses of <strong>Blaine County</strong> and the rugged peaks of <strong>Mount Chiliad</strong>[1][2][3]. The map is not only visually diverseâ€”featuring beaches, mountains, deserts, and bustling city streetsâ€”but it's also huge, measuring roughly 140 square miles (362 square kilometers)[2]. This makes it larger than several real-world cities and ensures plenty of space for adventure.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Safehouses: Your Home Base</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
Safehouses are more than just places to save your gameâ€”theyâ€™re crucial for storing vehicles, managing your characters, and escaping the heat after a wild mission. Each protagonist (Michael, Franklin, Trevor) has their own main safehouse, and additional properties can be unlocked as you progress.
</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Michaelâ€™s House</strong>: Located in Rockford Hills, this mansion is your introduction to luxury living in Los Santos.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Franklinâ€™s House</strong>: Starting in a humble home in South Los Santos, Franklin eventually upgrades to a Vinewood Hills residence.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Trevorâ€™s Trailer</strong>: Set in Sandy Shores, Trevorâ€™s safehouse is surrounded by desert and eccentric neighbors.
</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
As you earn more money, you can purchase additional properties across the map, each offering unique perks[1][3].
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Key Landmarks and Districts</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">

</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Hidden Spots and Easter Eggs</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
GTA 5 is packed with secret locations and fun surprises. Exploring off the beaten path can lead to hidden weapons, collectibles, or unique encounters. Some favorites among veteran players include:

</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">

</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Essential Services and Activities</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
Knowing where to find services can save you time and trouble:

Many of these locations are marked on the map, but some (like hidden collectibles or stunt jump spots) require a closer look or use of an interactive map tool.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for New Players</h2><ul>
