Grand Theft Auto V isnâ€™t just about high-speed chases and daring heistsâ€”itâ€™s also a playground for savvy investors. The gameâ€™s assassination missions, given by Lester to Franklin, offer a unique opportunity to turn the criminal underworld into a financial windfall. By making strategic investments in select stocks before and after each mission, players can multiply their in-game wealth exponentially and unlock the freedom to buy anything in Los Santos. This guide breaks down which stocks to buy, when to sell, and how to maximize your returns across all five assassination missions.
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Hotel Assassination</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
This is the only assassination mission required for GTA 5â€™s main story, and itâ€™s best to save the remaining four until after youâ€™ve completed all major heistsâ€”this way, your characters will have the most money to invest. For The Hotel Assassination, you should:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Invest in Betta Pharmaceuticals (BAWSAQ)</strong> before starting the mission.</li>
<li>Complete the mission, then sell Betta shares once they reach a return of <strong>50%</strong>.</li>
<li>After selling Betta, wait a few hours in-game until Bilkinton Research (LCN) hits its lowest price, then buy as many shares as possible.</li>
<li>Sell Bilkinton shares when they rebound, typically at an <strong>80% gain</strong>.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
Timing is crucial. BAWSAQ peaks immediately after the mission and then declines roughly 24 in-game hours later, so act fast for maximum profit.<br/>

This mission gives you the chance to double-dip on the stock market. Hereâ€™s how to play it:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Invest in Debonaire (LCN)</strong> before the mission.</li>
<li>After completing the hits, sell Debonaire shares when they reach an <strong>80-90% return</strong>.</li>
<li>Wait for Redwood Cigarettes (LCN) stock to drop to its lowest, then buy as many shares as possible.</li>
<li>Sell Redwood shares when they rebound, typically at a staggering <strong>300-400% return</strong>.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
This mission is a favorite for turning a small fortune into a massive oneâ€”Debonaire increases quickly, while Redwood may take up to 48 in-game hours to peak.<br/>

</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Vice Assassination</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
For this tech-focused hit, the stock strategy is:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Invest in Fruit Computers (BAWSAQ)</strong> before the mission.</li>
<li>Sell Fruit shares at a <strong>30-60% profit</strong> shortly after the mission.</li>
<li>Then invest in Facade (BAWSAQ) as Fruit peaks, and sell Facade at a <strong>20-40% gain</strong>.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
While not as lucrative as the other missions, following this pattern will still net a healthy profit.<br/>

</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Bus Assassination</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
This mission is straightforward:
</p><ul>
<li>No pre-mission investment required.</li>
<li><strong>Buy Vapid (BAWSAQ)</strong> immediately after the mission.</li>
<li>Sell Vapid shares when their price doubles for a <strong>100% return</strong>.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
The window for Vapidâ€™s price spike is shortâ€”watch the market closely.<br/>

</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Construction Assassination</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
The final Lester mission offers the biggest payday:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Invest in GoldCoast (LCN)</strong> before the mission.</li>
<li>Complete the hit, then sell GoldCoast shares once their price peaks at an <strong>80-90% return</strong>.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
If youâ€™ve followed all tips and invested all three protagonistsâ€™ cash, you could walk away with <strong>$2 billion or more</strong> per character. Use quick saves and sleep to track the peak price, then sell before values drop.<br/>

</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Maximizing Your Returns</h2><ul>
<li>Always invest <strong>all</strong> available money from Franklin, Michael, and Trevor before each mission.</li>
<li>Monitor the stock market in-game for price peaks and use quick saves to avoid missing out.</li>
<li>Remember that BAWSAQ and LCN stocks peak at different times; BAWSAQ usually spikes immediately, while LCN can take up to 24 in-game hours.</li>
<li>Do not rush through the assassination missionsâ€”wait until you have completed all major heists for maximum capital.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
These strategies turn the assassination missions into GTA 5â€™s ultimate money-making tool, letting you unlock every property, vehicle, and weapon with ease.
