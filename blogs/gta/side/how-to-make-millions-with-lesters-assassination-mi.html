    If youâ€™re aiming to become a billionaire in GTA 5â€™s story mode, <strong>Lesterâ€™s Assassination Missions</strong> are your golden ticket. These unique side missions not only challenge your stealth and strategy but also offer the biggest opportunity to amass a fortuneâ€”if you know how to exploit the <strong>stock market</strong> alongside them. In this guide, weâ€™ll break down everything you need to know to maximize your profits, including timing, investment tips, and mission walkthroughs.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Why Lesterâ€™s Assassination Missions Matter</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Lester Crest offers Franklin a series of assassination jobs targeting high-profile figures connected to major corporations. Every hit affects the in-game stock market, causing huge swings in share prices for both the targeted company and its competitors. By investing wisely before each mission, you can turn a modest bankroll into <strong>hundreds of millionsâ€”or even billions</strong> for each protagonist.<br/>
    The catch: <em>Timing is everything.</em> If you rush these missions, youâ€™ll miss the chance to invest big. The optimal strategy is to complete only the first required mission (The Hotel Assassination) early, then save the rest until after the final main story heist, when all three characters have the most cash to invest.<br/>
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Wait until you finish the main campaign before tackling the remaining four optional assassinations for maximum returns[2][4].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">The Optimal Strategy: Step-by-Step</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Hereâ€™s how to become a multi-millionaire using Lesterâ€™s missions:
  </p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Complete The Hotel Assassination</strong>: This mission is required to progress the storyline. Invest all your cash in <strong>Betta Pharmaceuticals (BET)</strong> on the BAWSAQ before starting. Sell when shares hit a roughly 21% return[5].
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Finish the Main Story</strong>: Play through all campaign missions, including "The Big Score," to maximize cash for Franklin, Michael, and Trevor. Do <em>not</em> play the other four assassinations yet[2][4][5].
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Invest and Assassinate</strong>: For each of the remaining Lester missions, invest all your cash (for all three characters) in the recommended stock before accepting the job. Complete the mission, then monitor the market for peak returns. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:
      <ul>
<li>
<strong>The Multi-Target Assassination</strong>: Invest in <strong>Debonaire (DEB)</strong> before starting. After the mission, sell when the stock peaks, and then invest in <strong>Redwood Cigarettes (RWC)</strong>â€”its value will rebound in a few days[2][3].
        </li>
<li>
<strong>The Vice Assassination</strong>: Invest in <strong>Fruit (FRT)</strong> before starting. Sell when the price surges post-mission[2][3].
        </li>
<li>
<strong>The Bus Assassination</strong>: Invest in <strong>Vapid (VAP)</strong> on BAWSAQ before starting. After the hit, wait about 24 in-game hours for the stock to peak at near 100% return, then sell for massive profit[3].
        </li>
<li>
<strong>The Construction Assassination</strong>: Invest in <strong>GoldCoast (GCD)</strong> before starting. The stock will soar post-mission, offering your final big payday[2][3].
        </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Sell at Peak</strong>: The LCN Exchange typically peaks one in-game business day after the assassination, while BAWSAQ surges immediately and starts to decline after about 24 hours[2]. Save your game, sleep, and check prices. If the peak drops, reload your save and try again[3].
    </li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Mission Walkthrough Tips</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Each assassination mission comes with its own challenges. Here are some key tips:
  </p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Multi-Target Assassination</strong>: Youâ€™ll have nine minutes to take out four jurors around Los Santos. Follow Lesterâ€™s texts and use the minimap for locations. Drive carefully to avoid police attention[1].
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Bus Assassination</strong>: Steal the bus, follow the designated stops, and take out Isaac Penny. For a gold medal, run him over with the bus, but shooting is quicker[1][3].
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Vice and Construction Assassinations</strong>: Plan your attack routes, and use silenced weapons for stealth. The missions are straightforward but require precision for gold medal objectives.
    </li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Remember, <strong>earning gold medals</strong> in these missions can also help you unlock the "Solid Gold, Baby!" Achievement/Trophy, but you can replay missions to improve your score[4].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How Much Can You Make?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    By following the investment strategy, players have reported making <strong>over $2 billion</strong> split among all three protagonists, with each holding more than $1.3 billion after the Bus Assassination if executed correctly[3]. This money allows you to buy every property, car, and weapon in the game, making you the richest in Los Santos.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul>
<li>
<strong>What if I already did some assassinations?</strong> Youâ€™ll still make good money, but not as much as if you waited until after the main story. Replay missions for gold medals but the investment opportunity is lost once the stock has peaked.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>How do I know when the stock has peaked?</strong> Check your portfolio after each mission; save and sleep to advance time. If the price starts dropping, reload your save and sell at the highest value[2][3].
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Can I use cheat codes?</strong> Yes, but they do not affect stock prices. Use them to clear wanted levels during missions if needed[1].
    </li>
