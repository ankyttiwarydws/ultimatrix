    If you've ever played Grand Theft Auto V, you know that not all missions are about fast cars and high-octane heists. In the mission <strong>Did Somebody Say Yoga?</strong>, Michael De Santa is pushed out of his comfort zone and onto a yoga mat. While it sounds relaxing, many players find this mission unexpectedly tricky. This guide will walk you through every step of the yoga mission, helping you pass it smoothly and even earn that elusive Gold Medal.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Overview: What is the GTA 5 Yoga Mission?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    "Did Somebody Say Yoga?" is the 26th main story mission in GTA 5. It centers around Michael as he joins his wife Amanda and her instructor, Fabien, for a session of yoga in their backyard. The mission stands out for its unique gameplay mechanics, requiring precision, timing, and a bit of patience rather than the usual GTA action. Completing this mission also unlocks yoga as a recurring activity in the game, contributing to your 100% completion progress.<br/>
<em>Reward:</em> Yoga becomes available as a hobby for Michael after the mission, and you can revisit it at any time for the 100% checklist[2].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How to Start the Mission</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The mission is triggered at Michaelâ€™s house. After a tense cutscene between Michael and Amanda, youâ€™ll be guided to the backyard to begin your first set of yoga poses with Fabien. Make sure to skip cutscenes if youâ€™re aiming for the Gold Medal time requirement.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Yoga Pose Breakdown: Controls and Perfect Timing</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    There are three yoga poses you must complete without errors for the best score:
  </p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Warrior Pose:</strong> This is the first pose, where you must move both analog sticks (or corresponding keys on PC) to match on-screen instructions, then hold both triggers (L2 + R2 / LT + RT) to breathe in and out. Donâ€™t release until prompted. Precision is keyâ€”release too early or too late, and youâ€™ll fail the pose[1][2].
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Triangle Pose:</strong> The second pose follows the same principle. Carefully align the limbs as shown, then execute the breathing cycle. The controls are identical, but the limb placement differs. Stay focused and donâ€™t rush.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Praise the Sun!:</strong> The third and final pose is a bit more complex. Take your time adjusting Michaelâ€™s arms and legs as directed. Once again, sync your breathing perfectly.
    </li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    If you make a mistake, you can retry the pose. However, to earn Gold, you must perform each pose flawlessly on at least one run[1][2].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Passing the Yoga Mission Easily</h2><ul>
<li>
<strong>Follow On-Screen Prompts:</strong> The game provides visual cues for stick movement and triggers. Focus on lining up the limbs exactly as shown.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Donâ€™t Rush the Breathing:</strong> Hold the triggers until told to release. Premature release often causes failure.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Practice Makes Perfect:</strong> If you fail a pose, you can replay the mission. Gold Medal objectives can be completed over multiple attempts.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Skip Cutscenes:</strong> If youâ€™re aiming for the Gold Medal, skip all cutscenes to finish within the 15-minute time limit[1].
    </li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">After the Yoga: Michaelâ€™s Hallucination Sequence</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Once the yoga session ends, the mission continues with a unique hallucination sequence involving Michael and his son, Jimmy. Youâ€™ll need to navigate this surreal event, then return Michael safely home. Keep moving forward, and donâ€™t worryâ€”this part is more about enjoying the story than skill-based gameplay.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Completing the Mission for 100% Gold</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    To achieve Gold Medal status, you must:
  </p><ul>
<li>Finish the mission in under 15 minutes (skip cutscenes where possible).</li>
<li>Complete all three yoga poses without fault.</li>
<li>Quickly finish the hallucination and return home.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    You can replay the mission later to improve your score, and each objective can be completed separately if needed[1][2].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Video Guide: Watch and Learn</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Sometimes, a visual guide helps more than words. Below is a recent, highly-rated YouTube walkthrough of the GTA 5 yoga mission, showing you exactly how to pass every part:

<strong>Q: Can I fail the yoga mission?</strong><br/>
    A: Yes, if you repeatedly fail the poses or donâ€™t follow instructions, youâ€™ll have to retry. However, the game lets you practice until you succeed.<br/><br/>
<strong>Q: Do I need to do yoga after the mission for 100%?</strong><br/>
    A: Yes! To tick yoga off the 100% checklist, you must complete a yoga session outside the mission at Michael's house or Mount Gordo[3].
