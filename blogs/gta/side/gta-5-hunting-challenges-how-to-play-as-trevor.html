<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">GTA 5 Hunting Challenges: How to Play as Trevor</h1><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Introduction</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Hunting is one of the most immersive and unique side activities in <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> (GTA 5), exclusively available to play as Trevor Philips. After meeting the eccentric marksman Cletus in Sandy Shores, players unlock a set of hunting challenges that blend stealth, marksmanship, and creativity. If you’re aiming for Gold Medals or just want a break from the chaos of Los Santos, this guide will walk you through how to play as Trevor, unlock hunting, and master every challenge.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How to Unlock Hunting in GTA 5</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    To access hunting, you must first complete two missions with Cletus in northeast Sandy Shores. Once these are done, hunting challenges appear on the world map, but <strong>only Trevor can participate</strong>. Remember, hunting is restricted to daylight hours for realism and challenge. The activity is a form of sports pastime, rewarding players with cash and unlocking new tiers of challenges[1].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Getting Started: The Basics of Hunting</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    When you begin, Trevor is equipped with an <strong>elk call</strong> to help locate prey. Wind direction matters — always stay downwind to avoid being scented and spooking animals. Using stealth mode while moving will further reduce your chances of detection. Throughout the event, you can photograph killed animals and text them to Cletus for extra cash and challenge completion[1].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Types of Hunting Challenges</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Hunting is divided into three main categories, each with multiple ranks and objectives[2]:
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Master Hunter Challenges</strong>: Focus on precision shots and efficiency with elk, such as killing multiple elk undetected or within a time limit.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon Master Challenges</strong>: Use a variety of weapons and tactics, like killing a coyote with a shotgun or running over a boar.</li>
<li><strong>Nature Photographer Challenges</strong>: Take and send specific photos of animals to Cletus, sometimes requiring multiple species in one shot.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Master Hunter Challenge Breakdown</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Here are the objectives you’ll need to complete:
  </p><ul>
<li>Rank 1: Kill an elk with a heart shot.</li>
<li>Rank 2: Kill 2 elk in a row without using the elk call.</li>
<li>Rank 3: Kill 3 elk in a row undetected.</li>
<li>Rank 4: Kill 4 elk within 4 minutes.</li>
<li>Rank 5: Kill 2 elk with a single shot.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    These tasks test your aim, stealth, and time management. Using cover and staying silent are crucial for higher ranks. For double kills, wait until two elk are lined up and use a powerful weapon[2][3].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Weapon Master Challenge Breakdown</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    This set encourages creative use of weapons and your environment:
  </p><ul>
<li>Rank 1: Kill a coyote with a shotgun.</li>
<li>Rank 2: Run a boar over with a vehicle.</li>
<li>Rank 3: Kill a mountain lion with a grenade.</li>
<li>Rank 4: Kill an elk without looking through the scope.</li>
<li>Rank 5: Kill any bird with the sniper rifle.</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Some of these, like the grenade challenge, require patience and timing. For the bird challenge, wait for birds to land or fly close and use the sniper rifle’s zoom for accuracy[2][3].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Nature Photographer Challenge Breakdown</h2><p class="image-credit">
    These objectives require you to use Trevor’s phone camera and send images to Cletus:
  </p><ul>
<li>Rank 1: Text a photo of a doe.</li>
<li>Rank 2: Text a photo of two dead elk.</li>
<li>Rank 3: Text a photo of a dead coyote and a dead boar.</li>
<li>Rank 4: Text a photo of an elk corpse and a charging cougar.</li>
<li>Rank 5: Text a photo of an elk, a cougar, a boar, and a coyote corpse (all in one).</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    These multi-species shots are tricky, but can be achieved by luring different animals together or exploring their spawning areas[2].
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Success (And Staying Alive)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Mountain lions</strong> pose a real threat while hunting. If attacked, switch to the assault shotgun for quick defense, as they can take Trevor down swiftly if ignored[1]. Always move in stealth, watch wind direction, and take your time lining up shots for challenge completion.
  </p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Remember, the hunting challenges are fun but not required for 100% completion of the game. Take on these side missions for extra cash, gold medals, and a fresh experience away from the usual mayhem of GTA 5[4].
