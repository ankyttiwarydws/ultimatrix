        The Taxi Driver side mission in <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong> lets players step into the shoes of a cabbie, picking up fares around Los Santos for quick cash and a change of pace from the usual story heists. Whether you want a break from chaos or aim to unlock special rewards, this guide covers everything you need to know to become the cityâ€™s best taxi driver.
    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How to Start Taxi Driver Missions in GTA 5</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        Starting a taxi mission in GTA 5 is effortless. Simply <strong>enter any taxi vehicle</strong> (look for the yellow cabs parked near the Downtown Cab Co. or cruising city streets) and press the horn button to activate the mission. A customer will be flagged on your map, and your task is to pick them up and deliver them to their requested destination as safely and quickly as possible<span>[3]</span>.
    </p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        All three protagonistsâ€”Michael, Franklin, and Trevorâ€”can participate in taxi missions. However, only Franklin can <strong>purchase the Downtown Cab Co.</strong> property, unlocking unique private fares and special side quests for extra rewards<span>[3]</span>.
    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Step-by-Step Walkthrough: Picking Up and Dropping Off Fares</h2><ul>
<li>
<strong>Find a Taxi:</strong> Approach a taxi vehicle and enter it.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Activate the Mission:</strong> Press the horn button (usually â€˜Eâ€™ on PC, or Left Stick on consoles) to start taxi work.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Pick Up the Customer:</strong> Drive to the highlighted location on your map to collect your passenger.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Take Them to Their Destination:</strong> Follow the GPS route, but drive carefullyâ€”your <strong>fare payout depends on time and vehicle condition</strong>. The faster and safer the trip, the higher your reward<span>[1][3]</span>.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Repeat:</strong> After drop-off, youâ€™ll quickly receive another fare offer. Accept it to keep the chain going and maximize your earnings.
        </li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        Beware: Passengers may sometimes try to skip out on payment. If this happens, you can chase them down to reclaim your cash, but this isnâ€™t required for every mission<span>[3]</span>.
    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Maximizing Your Taxi Driver Earnings</h2><ul>
<li>
<strong>Drive Safely:</strong> Damage to your cab reduces your tip. Avoid collisions and reckless driving.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Be Fast, But Not Furious:</strong> Speed matters, but so does safety. Find a balance to maximize fare payouts.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Chain Missions:</strong> Completing multiple fares in a row boosts your total rewards. Donâ€™t exit the taxi or cancel the chain unless necessary<span>[1]</span>.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Track Progress:</strong> After each drop-off, a notification appears above your map showing completed fares. If you quit the chain, your progress resets for bonus streaks<span>[1]</span>.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Protection:</strong> Taxis offer minimal protection from gunfire, so watch out for trouble, especially in certain neighborhoods<span>[1]</span>.
        </li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Special Fares and Unique Missions</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        While basic taxi missions are repeatable, purchasing <strong>Downtown Cab Co.</strong> as Franklin opens up a series of special fares with unique requirements and higher payouts. These missions include quirky customers, multi-stop fares, and even criminal escapades.
    </p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Liz:</strong> Drive a young woman to her destination. Complete it once to unlock her as a contact and earn extra cash<span>[5]</span>.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Three Businessmen:</strong> A group fare with multiple drop-offs and a potential tip over $500<span>[5]</span>.
        </li>
<li>
<strong>Bank Robbery Fare:</strong> Pick up and help escape a banker involved in a heist for a larger reward<span>[2]</span>.
        </li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        The full list includes over ten unique missions after purchasing the cab company, each with its own challenges and golden requirements for 100% completion<span>[2]</span>.
    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Taxi Work in GTA Online</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        GTA Online introduced expanded taxi work, including streak bonuses, fare chains, and special VIP fares. Completing <strong>50 fares</strong> can unlock additional rewards and reduce cooldown times for taxi missions. Some fares might change destinations mid-ride or request far-off locations for bigger tips and challenges<span>[1][4]</span>.
    </p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        VIP and CEO fares are rare and lucrative, offering tips up to $30,000 or more for a single ride. These special fares add variety and excitement to the otherwise straightforward side missions<span>[4]</span>.
