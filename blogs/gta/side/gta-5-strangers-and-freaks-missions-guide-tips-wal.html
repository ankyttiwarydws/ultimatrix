        The <strong>Strangers and Freaks</strong> missions in <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> are a collection of quirky, memorable side quests scattered throughout San Andreas. Marked by a "?" icon on your map, these encounters introduce you to some of the most eccentric characters in the game. While these missions are technically optional, completing select ones is crucial for achieving <strong>100% game completion</strong>[1][2][3].
    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How Strangers and Freaks Missions Work</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        These missions are unlocked as you progress through the main story and explore the world. Each protagonistâ€”<strong>Michael</strong>, <strong>Franklin</strong>, and <strong>Trevor</strong>â€”has their own set of Strangers and Freaks quests, many of which can only be initiated by a specific character[1][3]. Some missions branch into collectible hunts, stunt activities, or rampages, requiring you to travel, explore, and interact with the world in new ways.
    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Why Complete Strangers and Freaks Missions?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        Completing these missions not only adds depth to the game's narrative but is also essential for unlocking achievements and reaching 100% completion. Out of the 58 total missions, you need to finish <strong>20 specific ones</strong> for full completion[2][3]. Many also offer unique rewards, new vehicles, or simply a dose of classic GTA humor.
    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">List of Key Strangers and Freaks Missions Required for 100%</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        While you can complete any 20 missions for the completion requirement, certain ones are indispensable due to their connection with collectibles or story progression. Notable missions include:
    </p><ul>
<li><strong>Tonyaâ€™s Towing Missions</strong> (Franklin)</li>
<li><strong>Beverlyâ€™s Paparazzo Missions</strong> (Franklin)</li>
<li><strong>Haoâ€™s Race</strong> (Franklin)</li>
<li><strong>Barryâ€™s Drug Missions</strong> (Franklin)</li>
<li><strong>Mary-Annâ€™s Exercise Missions</strong> (Franklin)</li>
<li><strong>Domâ€™s Extreme Sports Missions</strong> (Franklin)</li>
<li><strong>Omegaâ€™s Spaceship Parts Hunt</strong> (Franklin)</li>
<li><strong>Peter Dreyfussâ€™s Letter Scraps Hunt</strong></li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        Other fun and bizarre encounters include rampages with Trevor, bounty hunts for Maude, and underwater searches with Abigail. Each mission chain features its own characters, unlock conditions, and objectives. For full details on each mission, including <strong>gold medal requirements</strong>, consult walkthroughs or checklists[1][3][4].
    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Gold Medal Objectives and Replayability</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        Like main story missions, Strangers and Freaks quests award a <strong>bronze, silver, or gold medal</strong> based on your performance. Gold medals require meeting specific criteria, such as completing a mission within a time limit or accomplishing bonus objectives. You can replay most missions to improve your medal rating, which is important for trophy hunters and completionists[3][5].
    </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Completing Strangers and Freaks Missions Efficiently</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Track Collectibles Early:</strong> For missions that involve collecting items (e.g., spaceship parts, letter scraps), start gathering them as soon as possible to avoid tedious backtracking.</li>
<li><strong>Use the Right Character:</strong> Many missions are exclusive to a specific protagonist. Switch between Michael, Franklin, and Trevor to see all available opportunities on your map[1].</li>
<li><strong>Monitor Objectives:</strong> Gold medal objectives can be missed if you donâ€™t pay attention. Check requirements before starting and replay as needed.</li>
<li><strong>Mix Main Story and Side Missions:</strong> Integrate Strangers and Freaks tasks into your main story progression to avoid burnout and maximize your time in Los Santos.</li>
<li><strong>Save Regularly:</strong> Some missions can be tricky or buggy; save your game before starting lengthy collectible hunts or multi-part chains.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Sample Mission Walkthrough: Pulling Favors (Tonya)</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
        One of the earliest Strangers and Freaks missions is <strong>Pulling Favors</strong> for Tonya. Franklin meets Tonya in Strawberry, drives to a tow truck, recovers an abandoned car, and delivers it to the impound lot. To earn a gold medal, complete the mission in under five minutes and keep the vehicle hooked until delivery. This mission is required for 100% completion[5].
