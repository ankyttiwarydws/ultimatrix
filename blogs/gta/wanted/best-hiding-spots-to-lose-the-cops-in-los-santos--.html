<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">Best Hiding Spots to Lose the Cops in Los Santos</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned Grand Theft Auto V player or a newcomer to Los Santos, one thing is certain: sooner or later, you‚Äôll have the cops on your tail. Outrunning the law is a classic thrill in GTA V, but when things heat up, knowing the best hiding spots can mean the difference between freedom and a wasted screen. In this guide, we‚Äôll explore the most effective and creative locations to lose your wanted level, based on in-game experience and the latest community insights from 2025.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Why Hiding Beats Running</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Evading the police isn‚Äôt always about speed. Sometimes, stealth and strategy win the day. When helicopters start circling and squad cars block every exit, ducking into a well-hidden location can reset your wanted level faster than a high-speed chase. The key is knowing where to go‚Äîpreferably somewhere the AI rarely searches and few players know about.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Top Hiding Spots in Los Santos</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Here‚Äôs a rundown of the most reliable, unique, and defensible spots to lose the cops in GTA Online and GTA V single-player:</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">Coveted Cove (Blaine County Waterfront)</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">This spot is <strong>tucked away north of the Palmer-Taylor Power Station</strong>, right on the Blaine County shoreline. Coveted Cove is a serene, off-the-grid cave perfect for stashing a boat or seaplane. It‚Äôs best accessed by water or air, and its natural cover makes it nearly invisible to pursuing officers. The location‚Äôs remoteness means few players‚Äîor cops‚Äîwill stumble upon you here. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/best-gta-online-secret-locations/" target="_blank">[2]</a></p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">Tongva Cave (Tongva Hills)</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Hidden among the rolling hills west of Los Santos, the <strong>Tongva Cave</strong> is a small, easily overlooked hideout with only one narrow entrance. Accessible by helicopter or a careful hike, this cave is defensible and rarely checked by the AI. It‚Äôs an ideal spot to regroup, lay low, or even set traps for persistent bounty hunters. <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-5-secret-areas-locations/" target="_blank">[4]</a></p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">Los Santos Airport Terminal</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">The <strong>LSIA terminal</strong> has an open interior with just two entrances, making it an effective place to lose pursuers. Most players and even the AI overlook this spot, as it‚Äôs not connected to missions or objectives. Simply slip inside and watch your wanted level drop as the chaos continues outside. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgUDj5IyUBM" target="_blank">[3]</a></p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">Large Hotel Swimming Pool (Downtown Los Santos)</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Located at the intersection of Boulevard del Perro and Dorset Drive, this secluded pool area is hidden behind nondescript doors marked ‚ÄúKeep Clear.‚Äù The pool is surrounded by a courtyard, providing plenty of cover and escape routes if things go south. It‚Äôs also a peaceful spot to regroup and wait out the heat, especially with flying vehicles. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/best-gta-online-secret-locations/" target="_blank">[2]</a></p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">Custom Shops and Abandoned Garages</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Los Santos Customs, especially the <strong>desert location near Grand Sonora</strong>, doubles as a quick repair shop and a bulletproof hiding spot. The garage doors are both blast-resistant and provide a visual shield from patrols. Some abandoned car shops and garages, as uncovered by the GTA community, also make surprisingly effective hideouts. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqRMzqnKUsA" target="_blank">[1]</a></p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">Alleyways and Dark Corners</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Classic but effective: <strong>alleyways, tunnels, and shadowy streets</strong> often go unchecked by police during chases, especially if you quickly swap vehicles or hide in the dark. Just be sure to park out of sight and stay off the radar until the wanted level disappears. <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/xbox360/634491-grand-theft-auto-v/answers/357857-whats-the-best-way-to-lose-cops-in-chases-" target="_blank">[5]</a></p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Staying Hidden</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Switch vehicles</strong> immediately after breaking line of sight. This throws off police and other players tracking your car.</li>
<li><strong>Use tunnels and underpasses</strong> to break helicopter line of sight. Many are scattered throughout the city and work wonders for stealthy escapes.</li>
<li><strong>Keep calm and wait it out.</strong> Most hiding spots work best if you stay put and avoid shooting or making noise, which can attract attention.</li>
<li><strong>Scout in advance.</strong> Knowing the map pays off. Spend some downtime exploring these locations so you can head straight there when things go sideways.</li>
