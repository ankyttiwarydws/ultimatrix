    In the ever-evolving world of GTA Online, few businesses have proven as reliable and lucrative as the <strong>Bunker</strong>. Since its introduction, gunrunning has become a cornerstone for players seeking a steady stream of income without constant micro-management. As of 2025, the bunker remains one of the most consistent moneymakers, balancing risk, reward, and a relatively hands-off approach. Whether youâ€™re a solo player or leading a crew, understanding how to maximize your bunker is key to financial success in Los Santos.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How Gunrunning Works: The Basics</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    The gunrunning enterprise revolves around purchasing a bunker, managing its staff, and selling illegal arms for profit. Once your bunker is set up, youâ€™ll use the in-game Disruption Logistics app to oversee operations. The bunker business cycle is straightforward:
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Acquire supplies</strong> (by buying or stealing)</li>
<li>Staff convert supplies into <strong>stock</strong> (sellable weapons)</li>
<li>Sell the stock in bulk for significant profit</li>
</ul><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    You can also assign staff to <em>research</em>, unlocking valuable weapon and vehicle modifications, but for pure income, dedicating all staff to manufacturing is the best bet<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Getting Started: Setting Up for Success</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    To dive into gunrunning, you must first purchase a bunker from Maze Bank Foreclosures. Not all bunkers are created equalâ€”location matters for logistics, especially when selling stock in public lobbies. Once you own a bunker, youâ€™ll need to become a CEO or Motorcycle Club President to access the Disruption Logistics terminal, where business management happens<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.
  </p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    After a brief setup mission, youâ€™ll be able to source supplies and start the manufacturing cycle. Investing in <strong>equipment</strong> and <strong>staff upgrades</strong> is essential for increasing both speed and profitability over time.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Maximizing Profits: Tips from Experts</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    To ensure a steady income, follow these proven strategies:
  </p><ul>
<li><strong>Buy supplies</strong> instead of stealing them. This costs money up front, but saves time and allows your operation to run in the background while you pursue other activities<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Always assign staff to manufacturing</strong> for pure profit. Research is useful, but slows down your money-making potential<a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Sell stock in public lobbies</strong> for the 1-2% high-demand bonus per player present, but avoid filling your bunker to maximum unless you have help. Selling smaller amounts guarantees a single delivery vehicle, minimizing risk and stress<a href="#ref3">[3]</a><a href="#ref4">[4]</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use CEO abilities</strong> like Ghost Organization to protect yourself and your cargo during sales<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Time your sales</strong>. With efficient resupplying and selling, players can earn up to $630,000 per sale cycle, especially if they take advantage of bonus contracts and events<a href="#ref4">[4]</a>.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Solo Play vs. Crew: Whatâ€™s Best?</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    While the bunker business is designed to be accessible to solo players, some missions are easier with associates. Solo sellers should stick to partial stock sales to guarantee only one delivery vehicleâ€”this is crucial for avoiding time constraints and riskier multi-vehicle missions. Players with friends or a crew can maximize profits by filling the bunker and selling all stock at once, but must coordinate to defend and deliver all vehicles<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
  </p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2><ul>
<li>Neglecting upgradesâ€”these pay for themselves quickly with faster production and higher sale prices.</li>
<li>Trying to research and manufacture simultaneouslyâ€”the split focus slows down your profit cycle.</li>
<li>Ignoring public lobby bonusesâ€”selling in invite-only lobbies is safer, but less profitable. Weigh your risk tolerance.</li>
<li>Letting your stock sit too longâ€”if your bunker is full, it becomes more likely to be raided, which can erase hours of progress<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Real Player Experiences</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
    Many seasoned players have shared tips and earnings from years of bunker grinding. Some report making over $1.8 million from their bunker alone, with steady routines of buying supplies, waiting for a full batch, then selling for maximum bonuses<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. Others highlight the importance of location, upgrades, and adaptabilityâ€”especially when new game updates or events change the meta.
