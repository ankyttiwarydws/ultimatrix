<div class="blog-content"><h1 class="blogs-month-heading blog-main-title">GTA 5 Assassination Missions: Stock Market Manipulation</h1><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Grand Theft Auto V is renowned for its open-world mayhem, gripping story, and endless opportunities for mischief—but when it comes to <strong>making money in story mode</strong>, nothing beats Lester’s assassination missions. With the right strategy, you can turn Franklin, Michael, and Trevor into billionaires by manipulating the in-game stock market. Here’s a complete, step-by-step guide to understanding and maximizing your profits from every assassination mission in GTA 5.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">How Assassination Missions Affect the Stock Market</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Lester’s assassination missions are unique story events where Franklin takes out key business figures. Each target’s death directly impacts the value of specific companies in the game’s two stock markets: <strong>BAWSAQ</strong> and <strong>LCN</strong>. By investing in the right companies before or after these missions, players can earn massive returns. The trick is knowing which stocks to buy and when to cash out for maximum profit.[1][2][4]</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">General Strategy: Invest, Wait, and Sell</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">Before starting any assassination mission, make sure you have completed the main heists to maximize your available cash. Then:</p><ul>
<li>Invest all three characters’ money in the recommended stock before or after the mission, as advised for each case.</li>
<li>Complete the assassination mission.</li>
<li>Wait for the stock price to peak—often by sleeping in-game to advance time—then sell for a large profit.[2][3]</li>
<li>Look for opportunities to invest in rival companies after the market reacts.</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Mission-by-Mission Stock Investment Guide</h2><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">The Hotel Assassination</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Before the mission:</strong> Invest in <strong>Betta Pharmaceuticals (BAWSAQ)</strong>.<br/>
<strong>After the mission:</strong> Sell Betta shares when they reach about a 50% return. Then, buy <strong>Bilkinton Research (LCN)</strong> at its lowest and sell at around an 80% return.[1][2]
</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">The Multi Target Assassination</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Before the mission:</strong> Invest in <strong>Debonaire (LCN)</strong>.<br/>
<strong>After the mission:</strong> Sell Debonaire shares at approximately 80% profit. Next, buy <strong>Redwood Cigarettes (LCN)</strong> at its lowest and sell once it rebounds, usually for a 300%+ return.[1][2][4]
</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">The Vice Assassination</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Before the mission:</strong> No need to invest.<br/>
<strong>After the mission:</strong> Invest in <strong>Fruit (BAWSAQ)</strong>, sell at a 25%+ return. Next, buy <strong>Facade (BAWSAQ)</strong> after it drops, and sell when it rebounds for about a 30% gain.[3]
</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">The Bus Assassination</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Before the mission:</strong> Invest in <strong>Vapid (BAWSAQ)</strong>.<br/>
<strong>After the mission:</strong> Sell Vapid shares at around 100% profit. This one is simple but effective.[4]
</p><h3 class="blogs-month-title blog-subsection-title">The Construction Assassination</h3><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">
<strong>Before the mission:</strong> Invest in <strong>GoldCoast (GCD - LCN)</strong>.<br/>
<strong>After the mission:</strong> Sell GoldCoast shares with all three characters once the value rises to about 90%. This is where you’ll likely hit the legendary $2 billion mark per character.[4]
</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Tips for Maximum Profit</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Save Often:</strong> Always create a manual save before starting each assassination mission. If you miss a stock’s peak, reload and try again.[3]</li>
<li><strong>Advance Time:</strong> Use the character’s bed to sleep and fast-forward in-game time, allowing the stock market to update.</li>
<li><strong>Invest as All Three Characters:</strong> Don’t forget Trevor and Michael! Switch to each one and invest their money before the mission starts.[1]</li>
<li><strong>Wait for the Rebound:</strong> After selling initial stocks, look for opportunities to buy rival companies at their lowest and sell as they recover.[3]</li>
</ul><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Why Timing Matters</h2><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">The LCN and BAWSAQ markets peak at different rates. LCN stocks usually hit their maximum within 24 in-game hours after the assassination, while BAWSAQ peaks immediately or shortly after mission completion. Monitor your portfolio closely and don’t be afraid to reload a save if you miss the optimal window.[2]</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Video Guide: How to Make Billions in GTA 5 Using the Stock Market</h2><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="blog-video" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6Uj2hhT6CI" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 100%;" width="560"></iframe><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph">This recent video breaks down the assassination missions and offers a visual guide to maximizing your in-game wealth.

    No, each Lester assassination mission can only be completed once. Make sure you invest wisely the first time.[2]</p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"><strong>Do I need to finish all heists before starting?</strong><br/>
    Yes, it’s highly recommended to finish the main story and heists to maximize available cash for investment.[4]</p><p class="blogs-month-desc blog-content-paragraph"><strong>What if I miss the stock peak?</strong><br/>
    Reload your pre-mission save and try again. Advancing time with sleep cycles helps.</p><h2 class="blogs-month-subheading blog-section-heading">Sources</h2><ul>
