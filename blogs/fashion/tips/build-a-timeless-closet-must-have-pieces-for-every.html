<li>
<strong>Little Black Dress (LBD):</strong><br/>
      The LBD is the ultimate multitasker. Elegant, simple, and endlessly adaptable, it transitions seamlessly from day to night with a change of accessories. Choose a silhouette that flatters your shape for maximum wearability.<br/>
<em>Occasions:</em> Cocktail parties, date nights, work events.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Classic White Shirt:</strong><br/>

<em>Occasions:</em> Work, casual outings, business meetings.<br/>
</li>
