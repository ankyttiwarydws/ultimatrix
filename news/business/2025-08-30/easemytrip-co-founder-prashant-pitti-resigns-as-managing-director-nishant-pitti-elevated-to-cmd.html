        <h2 id="news-short-desc">Indian traveltech firm EaseMyTrip announced a leadership reshuffle as co-founder Prashant Pitti resigned from his role as Managing Director with immediate effect.Prashant, who co-founded the company with his brothers Nishant and Rikant Pitti, said in his resignation letter that he intends to dedicate more time to mentoring startups, pursuing new ventures, and working on urban traffic solutions and other public-interest initiatives.He will, however, continue as a promoter and long-term shareholder, reiterating that no promoter intends to sell stock.Following his exit, the board approved the elevation of Nishant Pitti from Whole-time Director to Chairman-cum-Managing Director for a five-year term through May 2029, subject to shareholder approval.Nishant, who has been instrumental in steering EaseMyTrip‚Äôs bootstrap-to-IPO journey and its rise to unicorn status, will now oversee the company‚Äôs long-term vision with an expanded mandate.The board also appointed Vikas Bansal, a chartered accountant and seasoned tax professional with nearly two decades of experience at PwC and in corporate finance, as Whole-time Director for a five-year term. In addition, SMD & Co. was named as the company‚Äôs secretarial auditor for the period FY26‚ÄìFY30.The leadership transition comes at a challenging time for the company. EaseMyTrip‚Äôs revenue fell 25.5% year-on-year to Rs 114 crore in the first quarter of FY26, while profit after tax plunged 98.7% to Rs 44 lakh from Rs 34 crore a year earlier.In January, Nishant Pitti stepped down as chief executive, with Rikant Pitti taking over as CEO. On Friday, the company said both Nishant and Rikant have voluntarily chosen to forgo their salaries temporarily to underscore alignment with shareholder interests and reinforce confidence in EaseMyTrip‚Äôs long-term growth prospects.</h2>
