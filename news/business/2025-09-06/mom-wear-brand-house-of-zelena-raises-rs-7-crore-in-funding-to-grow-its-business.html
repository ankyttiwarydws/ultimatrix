        <h2 id="news-short-desc">House of Zelena, a maternity and postpartum apparel brand, has raised Rs 7 crore ($800,000) in a seed funding round co-led by Sprout Venture Partners and M Venture Partners, with participation from GSF and other angel investors. The round brings the startup's total funding to $1.2 million.The company said it will use the proceeds to strengthen supply chain capabilities, drive product innovation across its maternity and postpartum offerings, and expand its “mom-first” ecosystem through community-building and technology integrations.Founded in 2022 by Hina Priyadarshini and Mayank Kamal, House of Zelena positions itself as a women-centered alternative to baby-first brands. It emphasises comfort, body-adaptability and emotional well-being for mothers navigating pregnancy and postpartum. Its catalogue includes products such as postpartum sculptwear leggings, bump-friendly loungewear and leakproof innerwear.Over the last two years, the brand has built a community of more than 250,000 mothers and generates about 45 million monthly organic impressions across its digital platforms. It is now preparing to expand its offline presence with community events and a “SafeToFeed” café campaign. In September, the startup will also launch a refreshed brand identity aimed at deepening its connection with India’s growing mom community.</h2>
