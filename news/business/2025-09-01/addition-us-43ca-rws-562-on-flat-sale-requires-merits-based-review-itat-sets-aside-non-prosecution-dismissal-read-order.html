        <h2 id="news-short-desc">The Tribunal observed that once an addition is made under Section 43CA read with Section 56(2), it becomes necessary for the appellate authority to examine the merits of the assessee‚Äôs claim rather than dismissing the appeal on technical grounds of non-prosecution. It stressed that a merits-based review is essential, particularly where statutory exceptions such as Section 43CA(3) are invoked, since ignoring such claims would amount to denial of substantive justice.</h2>
