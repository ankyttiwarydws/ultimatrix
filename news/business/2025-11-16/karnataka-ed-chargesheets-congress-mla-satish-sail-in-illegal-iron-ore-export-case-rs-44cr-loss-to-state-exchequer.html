        <h1 id="news-title">Karnataka: ED chargesheets Congress MLA Satish Sail in illegal iron ore export case; Rs 44cr loss to state exchequer</h1>
        <h2 id="news-short-desc">Bengaluru: In a major development in the decade-old Belekeri iron ore illegal export case, the Enforcement Directorate(ED) has filed a detailed chargesheet before the Special Court for People’s Representatives against Congress MLA Satish Sail. The chargesheet asserts that the MLA is involved in criminal conspiracy, illegal financial transactions and facilitating large-scale iron ore exports that allegedly caused a loss of Rs. 44.09 crore to the state treasury. According to the ED, Sail, along with other accused, played an active role in exporting iron ore through unlawful means from the Belekeri port. The investigation alleges that instead of exporting the ore to genuine Chinese buyers as mandated, the accused rerouted the shipments through foreign shell companies, thereby masking the financial trail and violating export regulations. Foreign bank accounts revealed One of the most serious allegations in the chargesheet is that Satish Sail maintained foreign bank accounts in Hong Kong. The ED has cited evidence of accounts held in Hong Kong’s Standard Chartered Bank and ICBC Bank. The agency claims that these accounts were used to safegaurd the illicit funds linked to the illegal iron ore trade. According to the ED, the modus operandi involved exporting low-grade iron ore under inflated invoices, wrong declaration of the quantity and value and diverting the profits to safe-havens in abroad. These alleged actions, the agency says, were part of a coordinated criminal conspiracy involving exporters, shipping agents, customs officials and political actors. Massive gains for private company The chargesheet states that Mallikarjun Shipping Pvt. Ltd., a company linked to the illegal shipments, made profits of Rs. 27 crore through the alleged fraudulent exports. Investigators believe the company acted as a conduit between the exporters and overseas buyers, facilitating the transactions and ensuring the proceeds were transferred to foreign accounts. During the ED raids at Sail’s residence and other properties earlier, the agency seized Rs. 1.68 crore in unaccounted cash and 6.75 kg of gold. The seizure, according to the agency, substantiates the allegation of illegal proceeds being siphoned off and concealed. Frozen bank accounts and attached properties As part of the ongoing probe, the ED has frozen bank accounts holding Rs. 14.13 crore belonging to the accused. Further, the agency has provisionally attached three immovable properties valued at Rs. 21 crore, issuing notices under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). These actions mark one of the most significant breakthroughs in the long-standing investigation that dates back to the massive illegal mining and export scandals that once rocked Karnataka’s political and administrative establishment. Background of the Belekeri case The Belekeri port scam first came to light when large volumes of illegally mined iron ore were discovered to have been exported between 2008 and 2010. Several high-ranking officials and politicians were accused of facilitating these exports and massive irregularities were reported in documentation, transportation and customs clearances. Sail, who had earlier been interrogated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Lokayukta SIT, has maintained that he was not involved in any wrongdoing. However, the ED’s chargesheet claims otherwise, stating that the MLA had direct links to the financial transactions and decision-making that enabled the illegal exports.

Satish Sail, currently representing the Karwar constituency, is considered an influential figure in coastal politics. Opposition parties are expected to use the development to target the Congress government, especially at a time when corruption allegations are being widely debated. Party sources say the high command may seek an internal explanation from Sail, though a formal response is yet to be issued. Meanwhile, ED officials say the investigation is ongoing and further chargesheets may follow, depending on the outcome of financial forensic analysis and international banking records. The Belekeri scandal, which once exposed Karnataka’s illegal mining nexus, appears far from over, with the latest chargesheet rekindling public attention and intensifying scrutiny of the political figures involved.</h2>
