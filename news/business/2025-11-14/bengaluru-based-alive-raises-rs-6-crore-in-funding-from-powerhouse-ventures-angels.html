        <h2 id="news-short-desc">Alive, the Bengaluru-based experience tech startup, has raised Rs 6 crore in funding from Powerhouse Ventures and a group of angel investors and operators.The startup plans to use the fresh capital to expand into more Indian cities, strengthen its technology stack, and grow its network of experience creators.Founded in 2023 by Vivek Kumar, a former investor and serial entrepreneur, Alive builds and distributes curated, immersive experiences using its proprietary full-stack platform.The startup designs and manages original experiences across adventure, food, art, wellness, and culture. These range from sky adventures and vineyard brunches to pottery workshops, chef-led dinners, glamping stays, and other handcrafted activities that aim to spark emotion and connection.Alive said it has built more than 125 original experiences across five cities and books over a thousand experiences every month. It has partnered with The Leela Palace, Embassy International Riding School, Prestige Golfshire, and the Padukone-Dravid Centre for Sports Excellence to offer premium, tech enabled experiences.The startup claims to have recorded nearly 90x revenue growth in less than a year. Beyond consumers, Alive is also building an ecosystem for India’s emerging creator economy. Chefs, artists, and independent hosts use its platform to design and launch experiences, with many earning up to Rs 5 lakh per month.Its technology supports creator onboarding, content management, and automated discovery, helping small businesses and creative professionals build sustainable income. Alive’s user base is driven largely by young professionals aged 21 to 38 who are seeking more authentic, engaging activities in their cities.The startup is currently live in Bengaluru and Hyderabad and will launch in Goa next. It aims to be active in ten major Indian cities and three to five tourist destinations by 2026.Alive is targeting Rs 100 crore in annual recurring revenue by March 2027 and plans to scale to more than 500 experiences and over one lakh paying customers.Vivek Kumar, Founder, Alive, said, “Our mission at Alive is to massively upgrade quality of life in Indian cities. We are doing it through thousands of new and unique experiences produced with our tech-first, highly scalable approach. With Alive, we’re creating the lifestyle layer India never had and one that makes discovery, joy, and connection part of everyday life. India’s experience economy is where e-commerce was a decade ago, with full of untapped potential. We’re not just creating experiences, we’re shaping a cultural shift in how people live, celebrate, and connect.”Kshitij Golwalkar, General Partner, Powerhouse Ventures, said, “We see Alive as a category-defining company that’s blending technology, culture, and lifestyle to transform how Indians experience life. As disposable incomes rise and consumers seek meaning over materialism, Alive is perfectly positioned to lead India’s next multibillion-dollar movement, which is the experience economy.”</h2>
