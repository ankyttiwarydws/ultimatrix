        <h2 id="news-short-desc">Mindful food storage is about preserving food's "life force" and respecting its nourishment, according to Sekh Sahajan, head chef at NAAD Wellness. He recommends several key practices for optimum freshness and minimal waste. For cooked food, let it cool for 30 to 45 minutes before storing it in airtight glass or stainless steel containers on the middle shelf, and aim to use it within two to three days. When reheating, only warm up what you plan to eat to preserve taste and nutrition. For raw vegetables, keep them dry and use cloth bags or perforated covers to allow for air circulation. Store vegetables in the designated humidity-controlled drawer and keep ethylene-releasing fruits like apples and tomatoes away from leafy greens. To care for leafy greens, wrap them in a slightly damp towel and place them in a box with a dry paper towel. Finally, Sahajan suggests choosing seasonal ingredients, which align with Ayurvedic principles and tend to last longer.</h2>
