        <h2 id="news-short-desc">The special CBI court has refused to discharge builder Satyan Tandon, who has been booked for his alleged role in connection with the DHFL – Yes bank case, observing that it is a premature stage. CBI had arrested Tandon on May 27, 2022 and was granted bail on July 16, 2022. Tandon had thereafter sought discharge claiming that he has no links with the alleged loan given by Yes bank to DHFL.</h2>
