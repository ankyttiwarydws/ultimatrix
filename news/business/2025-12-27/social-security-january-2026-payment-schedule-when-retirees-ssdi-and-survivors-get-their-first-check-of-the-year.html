        <h2 id="news-short-desc">Social Security January 2026 payments: The Social Security Administration (SSA) has released its payment schedule for January 2026, including special timing for Supplemental Security Income. A key change this year is the 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) that takes effect with January 2026 benefits. This bump means most beneficiaries will see larger checks than in 2025. SSI recipients begin receiving the increase early on December 31, 2025, because January 1 is a federal holiday and regular payment rules shift accordingly.</h2>
