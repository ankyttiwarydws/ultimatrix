        <h2 id="news-short-desc">India Gears Up for Strategic Mineral Independence with New Reforms Union Minister for Coal and Mines, G Kishan Reddy, announced the commencement of critical mineral exploration in Mizoram and Assam, underscoring the government's strategic emphasis on self-reliance in mineral resources. The minister assured that state-specific legal frameworks will be respected and consultations with Northeastern states are underway.In an interview with ANI, Reddy revealed that Arunachal Pradesh has entered the auction realm for coal, and similar explorations are ongoing in Mizoram and Assam. This initiative aligns with the recent Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill 2025, which aims to curb import reliance and bolster domestic production.The government is committing to extensive mining sector reforms, including six legislative amendments. These efforts underline the strategic necessity of critical minerals‚Äîfrom mobile phones to aviation‚Äîwhile supporting India's national security goals. The Geological Survey of India (GSI) has allocated 1,200 projects for nationwide exploration, while the National Critical Mineral Mission is set to run with significant funding and investments.</h2>
