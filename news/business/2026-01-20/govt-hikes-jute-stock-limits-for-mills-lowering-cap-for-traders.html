        <h2 id="news-short-desc">Union Textiles Minister Giriraj Singh on Tuesday reviewed the issue of high prices of raw jute and decided to enhance its stock limits for mills, while lowering the cap for traders and balers to safeguard the interests of jute farmers.The minister directed that the ongoing de-hoarding drive by the Office of the Jute Commissioner will be further intensified to detect and act against hoarding beyond permissible stock limits. The current drive has already identified some traders and balers violating the norms, the textile ministry stated.To help the industry manage higher raw jute prices, the government has increased the purchase prices of B. Twill jute bags from time to time.The prices were raised from Rs 58-60 per bag in September 2024 to Rs 74 per bag in September 2025, and further to Rs 87.20 per bag in January 2026."These measures reflect the government's commitment to safeguarding the interests of jute farmers and workers, around 80 per cent of whom are based in West Bengal,</h2>
