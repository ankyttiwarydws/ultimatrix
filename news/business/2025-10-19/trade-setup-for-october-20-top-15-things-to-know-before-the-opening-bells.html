        <h2 id="news-short-desc">Experts believe that the Nifty 50 appears poised for a strong bull run. If it closes and sustains above the long bearish gap of October 3, 2024 (25,740), the first target to watch will be 26,000, followed by 26,200‚Äì26,300. This zone coincides with the record high of 26,277, last seen on September 27, 2023. On the downside, immediate support is placed at 25,500.</h2>
