        <h2 id="news-short-desc">In a major step to drive digital inclusion, Google and the World Bank Group have announced a new global alliance to accelerate digital transformation across emerging markets. The partnership aims to strengthen digital public infrastructure by deploying Open Network Stacks, which act as the backbone for citizens to access essential services in sectors like agriculture, healthcare and education. The initiative combines Google Cloud’s advanced AI technologies, including the Gemini models with the World Bank Group's development expertise. This powerful combination is expected to help governments quickly develop interoperable digital systems, as per an official release.</h2>
