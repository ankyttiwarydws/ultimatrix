        <h1 id="news-title">Gold market capitalization surges $300 billion as gold price hits $4,250: expert gold rate forecast shows $4,600 peak in 2026 – is gold still a buy?</h1>
        <h2 id="news-short-desc">Gold market capitalization jumped $300 billion overnight as gold price hit a record $4,250 per ounce. Experts forecast gold could climb to $4,600 by mid-2026 amid safe-haven demand, a weakening U.S. dollar, and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. The historic rally has investors asking: is gold still a buy? Short-term momentum is strong, but macroeconomic risks may create volatility, making careful timing critical for both retail and institutional investors.</h2>
