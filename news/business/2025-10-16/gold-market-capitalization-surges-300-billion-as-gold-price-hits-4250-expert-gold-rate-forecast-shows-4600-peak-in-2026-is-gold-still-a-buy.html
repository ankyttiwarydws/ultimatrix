        <h2 id="news-short-desc">Gold market capitalization jumped $300 billion overnight as gold price hit a record $4,250 per ounce. Experts forecast gold could climb to $4,600 by mid-2026 amid safe-haven demand, a weakening U.S. dollar, and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. The historic rally has investors asking: is gold still a buy? Short-term momentum is strong, but macroeconomic risks may create volatility, making careful timing critical for both retail and institutional investors.</h2>
